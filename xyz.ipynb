His face was cold \\nwith majestic contempt. But there was somethi ng false in all this that Amerigo Bonasera \\nsensed but did not yet understand. \\n“You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,” the judge said harshly. Yes, yes, thought \\nAmerigo Bonasera. Animals.  Animals. The two young men, glossy hair crew cut, \\nscrubbed clean-cut faces composed into hum ble contrition, bowed their heads in \\nsubmission. \\nThe judge went on. “You acted like wild beasts in a jungle and you are fortunate you did \\nnot sexually molest that poor girl or I’d put you behind bars for twenty years.” The judge \\npaused, his eyes beneath impressively th ick brows flickered slyly toward the \\nsallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera,  then lowered to a stack of  probation reports before \\nhim. He frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural desire. He spoke \\nagain. \\n“But because of your youth, your clean records, because of your fine families, and \\nbecause the law in its majesty does not s eek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three \\nyears’ confinement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.” \\nOnly forty years of professi onal mourning kept t he overwhelming frustration and hatred \\nfrom showing on Amerigo Bonasera’s face. His  beautiful young daughter was still in the \\nhospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these two animales went free? It \\nhad all been a farce. He wa tched the happy parents cluste r around their darling sons. \\nOh, they were all happy now, they were smiling now. \\nThe black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera’s throat, overflowed through tightly \\nclenched teeth. He used his wh ite linen pocket handkerchief and  held it against his lips. \\nHe was standing so when t he two young men strode freely up the aisle, confident and \\ncool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a glance. He let them pass without saying  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 3\\na word, pressing the fresh linen against his mouth. \\nThe parents of the animales were coming by  now, two men and two women his age but \\nmore American in their dress. They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was \\nan odd, triumphant defiance. \\nOut of control, Bonasera leaned forward to ward the aisle and shouted hoarsely, “You \\nwill weep as I have wept– I wil l make you weep as your children make me weep”– the \\nlinen at his eyes now. The defense attor neys bringing up the rear swept their clients \\nforward in a tight little band, enveloping th e two young men, who had started back down \\nthe aisle as if to protect their parents. A huge bailiff moved quickly to block the row in \\nwhich Bonasera stood. But it was not necessary. \\nAll his years in America, Amerigo Bonaser a had trusted in law and order. And he had \\nprospered thereby. Now, though his brain smoked with hatred,  though wild visions of \\nbuying a gun and killing the two young m en jangled the very bones of his skull, \\nBonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wi fe and explained to her, “They have \\nmade fools of us.” He paused  and then made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. \\n“For justice we must go on our knees to Don Corleone.” \\n* * *  \\nIn a garishly decorated Los Angeles hotel su ite, Johnny Fontane was as jealously drunk \\nas any ordinary husband. Sprawled on a red couch, he drank straight from the bottle of \\nscotch in his hand, then washed the taste away by dunking his mouth in a crystal bucket \\nof ice cubes and water. It was four in  the morning and he was spinning drunken \\nfantasies of murdering his tr ampy wife when she got home. If she ever did come home. \\nIt was too late to call his first wife and ask about  the kids and he felt funny about calling \\nany of his friends now that his career was plunging downh ill. There had been a time \\nwhen they would have been delighted, flattered by his calling them at four in the \\nmorning but now he bored them. He could ev en smile a little to himself as he thought \\nthat on the way up Johnny Fo ntane’s troubles had fascinated  some of the greatest \\nfemale stars in America. \\nGulping at his bottle of scotch, he heard finally his wife’s key in the door, but he kept drinking until she walked into the room and st ood before him. She was to him so very \\nbeautiful, the angelic face, soulful violet eyes , the delicately fragile but perfectly formed \\nbody. On the screen her beauty was magnified, spiritualized. A hundred million men all \\nover the world were in love with the face of  Margot Ashton. And paid to see it on the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 4\\nscreen. \\n“Where the hell were you?” Johnny Fontane asked. \\n“Out fucking,” she said. \\nShe had misjudged his drunkenness. He spra ng over the cocktai l table and grabbed her \\nby the throat. But close up to that magical fa ce, the lovely violet eyes, he lost his anger \\nand became helpless again. She made the mistake of smiling mockingly, saw his fist \\ndraw back. She screamed, “Johnny, not in the face, I’m making a picture.” \\nShe was laughing. He punched her  in the stomach and she fell to the floor. He fell on \\ntop of her. He could smell her  fragrant breath as she gasped for air. He punched her on \\nthe arms and on the thigh muscles of her s ilky tanned legs. He beat her as he had \\nbeaten snotty smaller kids long ago when he had been a tough teenager in New York’s \\nHell’s Kitchen. A painful pun ishment that would leave no lasting disfig urement of \\nloosened teeth or broken nose. \\nBut he was not hitting her hard enough. He couldn’t. And she was giggling at him. Spread-eagled on the floor, her brocaded gown hitched up above her thighs, she \\ntaunted him between giggles. “C ome on, stick it in. Stick it  in, Johnny, that’s what you \\nreally want.” \\nJohnny Fontane got up. He hated the woman on the floor but  her beauty was a magic \\nshield. Margot rolled away, and in a dancer’s  spring was on her feet facing him. She \\nwent into a childish mocking dance and chanted, “Johnny never hurt me, Johnny never \\nhurt me.” Then almost sadly with grave beaut y she said, “You poor silly bastard, giving \\nme cramps like a kid. Ah, Johnny, you always  will be a dumb romantic guinea, you even \\nmake love like a kid. You stil l think screwing is really like those dopey songs you used to \\nsing.” She shook her head and said, “Poor Johnny. Goodbye, Johnny.” She walked into \\nthe bedroom and he heard her turn the key in the lock. \\nJohnny sat on the floor with his face in  his hands. The sick, humiliating despair \\noverwhelmed him. And then the gutter toughne ss that had helped him survive the jungle \\nof Hollywood made him pick up the phone and call fo r a car to take hi m to the airport. \\nThere was one person who could save him. He would go back to New York. He would \\ngo back to the one man with the power, the wisdom he ne eded and a love he still \\ntrusted. His Godf ather Corleone. \\n* * *   “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 5\\nThe baker, Nazorine, pudgy and crusty as his great Italian loaves, still dusty with flour, \\nscowled at his wife, his nubile  daughter, Katherine, and his baker’s helper, Enzo. Enzo \\nhad changed into his prisoner-of-war uniform with its green-lettered armband and was \\nterrified that this scene would make him late reporting back to Governor’s Island. One of \\nthe many thousands of Italian Army prisoners paroled daily to work in the American \\neconomy, he lived in const ant fear of that parole being revoked. And so the little comedy \\nbeing played now was, for him, a serious business. \\nNazorine asked fiercely, “Have you dishonored my family? Have you given my daughter \\na little package to remember you by now that  the war is over and you know America will \\nkick your ass back to your village full of shit in Sicily?” \\nEnzo, a very short, strongly built boy, put his hand over his heart and said almost in \\ntears, yet cleverly, “Padrone, I swear by the Holy Virgin I have never taken advantage of \\nyour kindness. I love your daughter with all respect. I ask for her hand with all respect. I \\nknow I have no right, but if they send me  back to Italy I can never come back to \\nAmerica. I will never be abl e to marry Katherine.” \\nNazorine’s wife, Filomena, spoke to the point. “Stop all this foolish ness,” she said to her \\npudgy husband. “You know what you must do. Keep Enzo here, send him to hide with our cousins in Long Island.” \\nKatherine was weeping. S he was already plump, homely and sprouting a faint \\nmoustache. She would never get a husband as handsome as Enzo, never find another \\nman who touched her body in secret places with such respectful love. “I’ll go and live in \\nItaly,” she screamed at her father. “I’ll run away if you don’t keep Enzo here.” \\nNazorine glanced at her shrewdly. She was a “ hot number” this daughter of his. He had \\nseen her brush her swelling buttocks against Enzo’s front when the baker’s helper \\nsqueezed behind her to fill the counter baskets with hot loaves from the oven. The \\nyoung rascal’s hot loaf would be in her ov en, Nazorine thought lewdly, if proper steps \\nwere not taken. Enzo must  be kept in America and be m ade an American citizen. And \\nthere was only one man who could arrange such an affair. The Godfather. Don \\nCorleone. \\n* * *  \\nAll of these people and many others received engraved invitations to the wedding of \\nMiss Constanzia Corleone, to be celebrated on the last Saturday in August 1945. The \\nfather of the bride, Don Vito  Corleone, never forgot his old friends and neighbors though  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 6\\nhe himself now lived in a huge house on Long Island. The reception would be held in \\nthat house and the festivities would go on all day. There was no doubt it would be a \\nmomentous occasion. The war with the Jap anese had just ended so there would not be \\nany nagging fear for their sons fighting in th e Army to cloud these festivities. A wedding \\nwas just what people needed to show their joy. \\nAnd so on that Saturday morning the fri ends of Don Corleone stre amed out of New York \\nCity to do him honor. They bore cream-color ed envelopes stuffed with cash as bridal \\ngifts, no checks. Inside each envelope a card established the identity of the giver and the measure of his respect for t he Godfather. A res pect truly earned. \\nDon Vito Corleone was a man to whom every body came for help, and never were they \\ndisappointed. He made no empty promises, nor  the craven excuse that his hands were \\ntied by more powerful forces in the world than himself. It was not necessary that he be \\nyour friend, it was not even important that you had no means with which to repay him. \\nOnly one thing was required. That you, you y ourself, proclaim your friendship. And then, \\nno matter how poor or powerless the supplicant, Don Corleone would take that man’s \\ntroubles to his heart. And he would let nothing stand in the way to a solution of that \\nman’s woe. His reward? Friendship, the re spectful title of “Don,” and sometimes the \\nmore affectionate salutation of “Godfather.” And perhaps, to show respect only, never \\nfor profit, some humble gift– a gallon of  homemade wine or a basket of peppered \\ntaralles– specially baked to grace his Chri stmas table. It was u nderstood, it was mere \\ngood manners, to proclaim that you were in  his debt and that he had the right to call \\nupon you at any time to redeem your debt by some small service. \\nNow on this great day, his daughter’s wedding day, Don Vito Corleone stood in the \\ndoorway of his Long Beach home to greet his guests, all of them known, all of them \\ntrusted. Many of them owed their good fort une in life to the Don and on this intimate \\noccasion felt free to call hi m “Godfather” to his face. Even the people performing festal \\nservices were his friends. The bartender was an old comrade whose gift was all the wedding liquors and his own ex pert skills. The waiters were the friends of Don \\nCorleone’s sons. The food on the garden picn ic tables had been cooked by the Don’s \\nwife and her friends and the gaily festoone d one-acre garden itself  had been decorated \\nby the young girl–chu ms of the bride. \\nDon Corleone received everyon e– rich and poor, powerful an d humble– with an equal \\nshow of love. He slighted no one. That was hi s character. And the guests so exclaimed \\nat how well he looked in hi s tux that an inexperienced observer might easily have  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 7\\nthought the Don himself was the lucky groom. \\nStanding at the door with him were two of his three sons. The eldest, baptized Santino \\nbut called Sonny by everyone except his father, was looked at askance by the older \\nItalian men; with admiration by the younger. Sonny Corleone was tall for a \\nfirst-generation American of Ita lian parentage, almost six feet, and his crop of bushy, \\ncurly hair made him look even taller. His face  was that of a gross Cupid, the features \\neven but the bow-shaped lips thickly sensual, t he dimpled cleft chin in some curious way \\nobscene. He was built as po werfully as a bull and it was common knowledge that he \\nwas so generously endowed by nature that  his martyred wife feared the marriage bed \\nas unbelievers once feared the rack. It was whispered that when as a youth he had \\nvisited houses of ill fame, even the most hardened and fearless putain, after an awed \\ninspection of his massiv e organ, demanded double price. \\nHere at the wedding feast, some young ma trons, wide-hipped, wid e-mouthed, measured \\nSonny Corleone with coolly confident eyes. Bu t on this particular day they were wasting \\ntheir time. Sonny Corleone, despite the pres ence of his wife and three small children, \\nhad plans for his sister’s maid of honor, Lucy Mancini. This young girl, fully aware, sat at a garden table in her pink formal gown, a tiara of flowers in her glossy black hair. She \\nhad flirted with Sonny in the past week of rehearsals  and squeezed his hand that \\nmorning at the altar. A maiden could do no more. \\nShe did not care that he w ould never be the great man hi s father had proved to be. \\nSonny Corleone had strength, he had courage. He was generous and his heart was \\nadmitted to be as big as his organ. Yet he di d not have his father’s humility but instead a \\nquick, hot temper that led him into errors  of judgment. Though he was a great help in his \\nfather’s business, there were many who doubt ed that he would become the heir to it. \\nThe second son, Frederico, called Fred or Fr edo,was a child every Italian prayed to the \\nsaints for. Dutiful, loyal, always at the service of his father, livi ng with his parents at age \\nthirty. He was short and burly, not handsom e but with the same Cupid head of the \\nfamily, the curly helmet of hair over the round face and sensual bow-shaped lips. Only, \\nin Fred, these lips were not sensual but granitelike. Inclin ed to dourness, he was still a \\ncrutch to his father, never disputed hi m, never embarrassed him by scandalous behavior \\nwith women. Despite all thes e virtues he did not have that personal magnetism, that \\nanimal force, so necessary for a leader of men, and he too was not expected to inherit \\nthe family business.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 8\\nThe third son, Michael Corl eone, did not stand with his fa ther and his two brothers but \\nsat at a table in the most secluded corner of the garden.  But even there he could not \\nescape the attentions of  the family friends. \\nMichael Corleone was the youngest son of the Don and the only child who had refused \\nthe great man’s direction. He did not have the heavy, C upid-shaped face of the other \\nchildren, and his jet black ha ir was straight rather than curly. His skin was a clear \\nolive-brown that would have been called beautiful in a girl. He was handsome in a \\ndelicate way. Indeed there had been a time  whey the Don had worried about his \\nyoungest son’s masculinity. A worry that was put to rest when Michael Corleone \\nbecame seventeen years old. \\nNow this youngest son sat at a table in the ex treme corner of the garden to proclaim his \\nchosen alienation from father  and family. Beside him sat the American girl everyone had \\nheard about but whom no one had seen until this day. He had, of course, shown the \\nproper respect and introduced her to everyone at the wedding, including his family. They \\nwere not impressed with her. She was too th in, she was too fair, her face was too \\nsharply intelligent for a wom an, her manner too free for a maiden. Her name, too, was \\noutlandish to their ears; she called herself Ka y Adams. If she had told them that her \\nfamily had settled in America two hundred years ago and her name was a common one, \\nthey would have shrugged. \\nEvery guest noticed that the Don paid no particul ar attention to this third son. Michael \\nhad been his favorite before the war and obviously  the chosen heir to run the family \\nbusiness when the proper moment came. He ha d all the quiet force and intelligence of \\nhis great father, the born instinct to act in such a way that men had no recourse but to respect him. But when World War II broke out, Michael Corleone volunteered for the \\nMarine Corps. He defied his father’s  express command when he did so. \\nDon Corleone had no desire, no intention, of letti ng his youngest so n be killed in the \\nservice of a power foreign to himself. Doctors had been bribed, secret arrangements \\nhad been made. A great deal of money had been spent to take the proper precautions. \\nBut Michael was twenty-one years of age and nothing could be do ne against his own \\nwillfulness. He enlisted and fought over t he Pacific Ocean. He became a Captain and \\nwon medals. In 1944 his picture was printed in Life magazin e with a photo layout of his \\ndeeds. A friend had shown Don Co rleone the magazine (his fa mily did not dare), and \\nthe Don had grunted disdainfully and said, “H e performs those miracles for strangers.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 9\\nWhen Michael Corleone was discharged early in 1945 to recover from a disabling \\nwound, he had no idea that his father had arranged his releas e. He stayed home for a \\nfew weeks, then, without consulting anyone,  entered Dartmouth College in Hanover, \\nNew Hampshire, and so he left his father’s house.  To return for the wedding of his sister \\nand to show his own future wife to them , the washed-out rag of an American girl. \\nMichael Corleone was amusing Kay Adams by te lling her little stories about some of the \\nmore colorful wedding guests. He was, in  turn, amused by her finding these people \\nexotic, and, as always, charmed by her intense interest in anything new and foreign to \\nher experience. Finally her attention was caught by a sm all group of men gathered \\naround a wooden barrel of homemade wine. The men were Amerigo Bonasera, \\nNazorine the Baker, Anthony Coppola and Luca Br asi. With her usual alert intelligence \\nshe remarked on the fact that these four men did not seem particularly happy. Michael \\nsmiled. “No, they’re not,” he said . “They’re waiting to see my fa ther in private. They have \\nfavors to ask.” And indeed it was easy to see that all four men c onstantly followed the \\nDon with their eyes. \\nAs Don Corleone stood greeting guests, a black Chevrolet sedan came to a stop on the \\nfar side of the paved mall. Tw o men in the front seat pulled notebooks from their jackets \\nand, with no attempt at concealment, jotted down license numbers of the other cars \\nparked around the mall. Sonny turned to his father and said, “Those guys over there \\nmust be cops.” \\nDon Corleone shrugged. “I don’t own the st reet. They can do what they please.” \\nSonny’s heavy Cupid face grew red wit h anger. “Those lousy bastards, they don’t \\nrespect anything.” He left the steps of t he house and walked across the mall to where \\nthe black sedan was parked. He thrust his face  angrily close to the face of the driver, \\nwho did not flinch but flapped open his wallet to show a green identification card. Sonny \\nstepped back without saying a word. He spat so that the spi ttle hit the back door of the \\nsedan and walked away. He was hoping the driv er would get out of the sedan and come \\nafter him, on the mall, but  nothing happened. When he reached the steps he said to his \\nfather, “Those guys are FBI men. They’re taking down all the license numbers. Snotty \\nbastards.” \\nDon Corleone knew who they were. His cl osest and most intimate friends had been \\nadvised to attend the weddi ng in automobiles not their own. And t hough he disapproved \\nof his son’s foolish display of  anger, the tantrum served a purpose. It would convince the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 10\\ninterlopers that their presence was unexpec ted and unprepared for. So Don Corleone \\nhimself was not angry. He had long ago learned that society im poses insults that must \\nbe borne, comforted by the kno wledge that in this world there comes a time when the \\nmost humble of men, if he keeps his eyes  open, can take his revenge on the most \\npowerful. It was this knowledge that prevented the Don from losing the humility all his \\nfriends admired in him. \\nBut now in the garden, behi nd the house, a four-piece  band began to play. All the \\nguests had arrived. Don Corleon e put the intruders out of hi s mind and led his two sons \\nto the wedding feast. \\n* * *  \\nThere were, now, hundreds of guests in t he huge garden, some dancing on the wooden \\nplatform bedecked with flowers, others sitting at  long tables piled high with spicy food \\nand gallon jugs of black, hom emade wine. The bride,  Connie Corleone, sat in splendor \\nat a special raised table with  her groom, the maid of honor , bridesmaids and ushers. It \\nwas a rustic setting in the old Italian style. Not to the bride’s taste, but Connie had \\nconsented to a “guinea” wedding to please her father because she had so displeased \\nhim in her choice of a husband. \\nThe groom, Carlo Rizzi, was a half-breed, bor n of a Sicilian father  and the North Italian \\nmother from whom he had inherited his blond hair and blue eyes. His parents lived in Nevada and Carlo had left that state because of a little trouble with the law. In New York \\nhe met Sonny Corleone and so met the sister. Don Corleone, of course, sent trusted \\nfriends to Nevada and they reported that Carlo’s police trouble was a youthful \\nindiscretion with a gun, not seri ous, that could eas ily be wiped off the books to leave the \\nyouth with a clean record. They also ca me back with detailed information on legal \\ngambling in Nevada which greatly interested the Don and which he had been pondering \\nover since. It was part of the Don’s gr eatness that he profit ed from everything. \\nConnie Corleone was a not quite  pretty girl, thin and nervous and certain to become \\nshrewish later in life. But today, transfo rmed by her white bridal gown and eager \\nvirginity, she was so radiant  as to be almost beautiful. Beneath the wooden table her \\nhand rested on the muscular thigh of her gr oom. Her Cupid-bow mouth pouted to give \\nhim an airy kiss. \\nShe thought him incredibly handsome. Carlo Rizzi had worked in  the open desert air \\nwhile very young– heavy laborer’s work . Now he had tremendous forearms and his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 11\\nshoulders bulged the jacket of his tux. He basked in the adoring eyes of his bride and \\nfilled her glass with wine. He  was elaborately courteous to her as if they were both \\nactors in a play. But his eyes kept flickeri ng toward the huge silk purse the bride wore on \\nher right shoulder and which was now stuffed full of mo ney envelopes. How much did it \\nhold? Ten thousand? Twenty thous and? Carlo Rizzi smiled. It was only the beginning. \\nHe had, after all, married into a royal family . They would have to take care of him. \\nIn the crowd of guests a dapper young man wit h the sleek head of a ferret was also \\nstudying the silk purse. From sheer habit Paulie Gatto won dered just how he could go \\nabout hijacking that fat pocketbook. The idea amused him. But he knew it was idle, \\ninnocent dreaming as small children drea m of knocking out tanks with popguns. He \\nwatched his boss, fat, middle-aged Peter Clemenza whirling young girls around the wooden dance floor in a rustic and lusty Tarantella. Clemenza, immensely tall, \\nimmensely huge, danced with such skill and abandon, his hard belly lecherously \\nbumping the breasts of younger, ti nier women, that all the gu ests were applauding him. \\nOlder women grabbed his arm to becom e his next partner. The younger men \\nrespectfully cleared off the floor and clapped t heir hands in time to the mandolin’s wild \\nstrumming. When Clemenza finally collapsed in  a chair, Paulie Gatto brought him a \\nglass of icy black wine and wip ed the perspiring Jovelike brow  with his silk handkerchief. \\nClemenza was blowing like a whale as he gulped down th e wine. But instead of \\nthanking Paulie he said curtly, “Never mind being a dance judge, do your job. Take a \\nwalk around the ne ighborhood and see everything is OK.” Paulie slid away into the \\ncrowd. \\nThe band took a refreshment break. A yo ung man named Nino Va lenti picked up a \\ndiscarded mandolin, put his left foot up on a chair and began to sing a coarse Sicilian \\nlove song. Nino Valenti’s face was handsom e though bloated by continual drinking and \\nhe was already a little drunk. He rolled hi s eyes as his tongue caressed the obscene \\nlyrics. The women shrieked wit h glee and the men shouted t he last word of each stanza \\nwith the singer. \\nDon Corleone, notoriously st raitlaced in such matter s, though his stout wife was \\nscreaming joyfully with the ot hers, disappeared tactfully into the house. Seeing this, \\nSonny Corleone made his way to the bri de’s table and sat down beside young Lucy \\nMancini, the maid of honor. They were safe. His wife was in the kitchen putting the last \\ntouches on the serving of the wedding cake. Sonny whispered a few words in the young girl’s ear and she rose. Sonny waited a few minutes and then casually followed her,  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 12\\nstopping to talk with a guest here and there as he worked his way through the crowd. \\nAll eyes followed them. The maid of honor , thoroughly Americanized by three years of \\ncollege, was a ripe girl who already h ad a “reputation.” All through the marriage \\nrehearsals she had flirted with Sonny Corleone in a teasing, joking way she thought was \\npermitted because he was the be st man and her wedding part ner. Now holding her pink \\ngown up off the ground, Lucy Mancini went in to the house, smiling with false innocence; \\nran lightly up the stairs to the bathroom. She stayed there for a few moments. When she \\ncame out Sonny Corleone was on the landing above, beckoning her upward. \\nFrom behind the closed window of Don Corleone’s “office,” a slightly raised corner room, \\nThomas Hagen watched the wedding party in  the festooned garden. The walls behind \\nhim were stacked with law books. Hagen was the Don’s lawyer and acting Consigliere, \\nor counselor, and as such held the most vital subordinate position in the family \\nbusiness. He and the Don had solved many a k notty problem in this  room, and so when \\nhe saw the Godfather leave the festivities and enter the hous e, he knew, wedding or no, \\nthere would be a little work this day. The Don would be coming to see him. Then Hagen \\nsaw Sonny Corleone whisper in Lucy Manc ini’s ear and their li ttle comedy as he \\nfollowed her into the house. Hagen grimaced, debated whether to inform the Don, and \\ndecided against it. He went to the desk and  picked up a handwritten list of the people \\nwho had been granted permission to see Do n Corleone privately. When the Don \\nentered the room, Hagen handed him the list. Don Corleone nodded and said, “Leave \\nBonasera to the end.” \\nHagen used the French door s and went directly out in to the garden to where the \\nsupplicants clustered around the barrel of wi ne. He pointed to the baker, the pudgy \\nNazorine. \\nDon Corleone greeted the baker with an embrace. They had pl ayed together as children \\nin Italy and had grown up in friendship. Ev ery Easter freshly baked clotted-cheese and \\nwheat-germ pies, their crusts yolk-gold, big around as tr uck wheels, arrived at Don \\nCorleone’s home. On Christmas, on family bi rthdays, rich creamy pastries proclaimed \\nthe Nazorines’ respect. And all through the years, lean and fat, Nazorine cheerfully paid \\nhis dues to the bakery union organized by t he Don in his salad days. Never asking for a \\nfavor in return except for the chance to buy black-market OPA sugar coupons during the \\nwar. Now the time had come for the baker to claim his rights as a loyal friend, and Don \\nCorleone looked forward with great pleasure to granting his request.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 13\\nHe gave the baker a Di Nobili cigar and a glass of yellow Strega and put his hand on the \\nman’s shoulder to urge him on. That was the mark of the Don’s humanity. He knew from \\nbitter experience what courage it took to ask a favor from a fellow man. \\nThe baker told the story of hi s daughter and Enzo. A fine Itali an lad from Sicily; captured \\nby the American Army; sent to the United States as a prison er of war; given parole to \\nhelp our war effort! A pure and honorable love had sprung up between honest Enzo and \\nhis sheltered Katherine but  now that the war was ended the poor lad would be \\nrepatriated to Italy and Nazorine’s daughter would surely die of a broken heart. Only \\nGodfather Corleone c ould help this afflicted couple. He was their last hope. \\nThe Don walked Nazorine up and down the r oom, his hand on the baker’s shoulder, his \\nhead nodding with understanding to keep up the man’s cour age. When the baker had \\nfinished, Don Corleone smiled at him and sa id, “My dear friend, put all your worries \\naside.” He went on to explain very care fully what must be done. The Congressman of \\nthe district must be petiti oned. The Congressman would pro pose a special bill that \\nwould allow Enzo to become a citizen. The bill would surely pass Congress. A privilege \\nall those rascals extended to each other. Don Corleone explained that  this would cost \\nmoney, the going price was now two thous and dollars. He, Don Corleone, would \\nguarantee performance and accept pay ment. Did his friend agree? \\nThe baker nodded his head vigorously. He did not expect such a great favor for nothing. \\nThat was understood. A special Act of Congress does not  come cheap. Nazorine was \\nalmost tearful in his thanks. Don Corleone walked him to the door, assuring him that \\ncompetent people would be sent to the bakery to arrange all det ails, complete all \\nnecessary documents. The baker embraced him before disappeari ng into the garden. \\nHagen smiled at the Don. “That ’s a good investment for Nazorine. A son-in-law and a \\ncheap lifetime helper in his bakery all for two thousand dollars.” He paused. “Who do I \\ngive this job to?” \\nDon Corleone frowned in thought. “Not to our paisan. Give it  to the Jew in the next \\ndistrict. Have the home addresses changed. I think there might be many such cases \\nnow the war is over; we should have extra people in Washington that can handle the \\noverflow and not raise the price.” Hagen m ade a note on his pad.  “Not Congressman \\nLuteco. Try Fischer.” \\nThe next man Hagen brought in was a ve ry simple case. His name was Anthony \\nCoppola and he was the son of  a man Don Corleone had wo rked with in the railroad  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 14\\nyards in his youth. Coppola needed five hund red dollars to open a pizzeria; for a deposit \\non fixtures and the special oven. For reasons  not gone into, credit was not available. \\nThe Don reached into his pocket and took out a roll of bills. It was not quite enough. He \\ngrimaced and said to Tom Hagen, “Loan me a hundred dollars, I’ll pay you back Monday \\nwhen I go to the bank.” The supplicant protes ted that four hundred dollars would be \\nample, but Don Corleone patted his shoul der, saying, apologetically, “This fancy \\nwedding left me a little short of cash.” He took the money  Hagen extended to him and \\ngave it to Anthony Coppola with his own roll of bills. \\nHagen watched with quiet admiration. The Don always taught that when a man was \\ngenerous, he must show the gener osity as personal. How fla ttering to Anthony Coppola \\nthat a man like the Don would borrow to loan him money. No t that Coppola did not know \\nthat the Don was a millionaire but how many millionaires let themselves be put to even a \\nsmall inconvenience by a poor friend? \\nThe Don raised his head inquir ingly. Hagen said, “He’s not on the list but Luca Brasi \\nwants to see you. He understands  it can’t be public but he w ants to congratulate you in \\nperson.” \\nFor the first time the Don seemed disp leased. The answer was devious. “Is it \\nnecessary?” he asked. \\nHagen shrugged. “You understand him better than I do. But he was very grateful that \\nyou invited him to the wedding. He never expected that. I think he wants to show his \\ngratitude.” \\nDon Corleone nodded and gestured that Luca Brasi should be brought to him. \\nIn the garden Kay Adams was struck by the vi olet fury imprinted on the face of Luca \\nBrasi. She asked about him. Michael had brought Kay to the wedding so that she would \\nslowly and perhaps without too mu ch of a shock, absorb the truth about his father. But \\nso far she seemed to regard the Don as a slightly unethical businessman. Michael \\ndecided to tell her part of the truth indirect ly. He explained that Luca Brasi was one of \\nthe most feared men in the East ern underworld. His great talen t, it was said, was that he \\ncould do a job of murder all by himself, without confederates , which automatically made \\ndiscovery and conviction by the law almost im possible. Michael grim aced and said, “I \\ndon’t know whether all that stu ff is true. I do know he is sort  of a friend to my father.” \\nFor the first time Kay began to understand. She asked a little incredulously, “You’re not \\nhinting that a man like that  works for your father?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 15\\nThe hell with it, he thought. He said, strai ght out, “Nearly fifteen years ago some people \\nwanted to take over my father’s oil importing  business. They tried to kill him and nearly \\ndid. Luca Brasi went after them . The story is that he killed six men in two weeks and that \\nended the famous olive oil war.” He smiled as if it were a joke. \\nKay shuddered. “You mean your fa ther was shot by gangsters?” \\n“Fifteen years ago,” Michael said. “Everyth ing’s been peaceful since then.” He was \\nafraid he had gone too far. \\n“You’re trying to scare me,” Kay said. “You ju st don’t want me to marry you.” She smiled \\nat him and poked his ribs with her elbow. “Very clever.” \\nMichael smiled back at her. “I want  you to think about it,” he said. \\n“Did he really kill six men?” Kay asked. \\n“That’s what the newspapers claimed,” Mike said. “Nobody ev er proved it. But there’s \\nanother story about him t hat nobody ever tells. It’s supposed to be so terrible that even \\nmy father won’t talk about it. Tom Hagen knows the story and he won’t tell me. Once I \\nkidded him, I said, ‘When will I be old enou gh to hear that stor y about Luca?’ and Tom \\nsaid, ‘When you’re a hundred.’ ”Michael sipped his glass of wine. “That must be some \\nstory. That must be some Luca.” \\nLuca Brasi was indeed a man to frighten the devil in hell himself. Short, squat, \\nmassive-skulled, his presence sent out ala rm bells of danger. His face was stamped into \\na mask of fury. The eyes were brown but with  none of the warmth of that color, more a \\ndeadly tan. The mouth was not so much cruel as  lifeless; thin, rubbery and the color of \\nveal. \\nBrasi’s reputation for violence was aw esome and his devotion to Don Corleone \\nlegendary. He was, in himself, one of the great blocks that suppor ted the Don’s power \\nstructure. His kind was a rarity. \\nLuca Brasi did not fear the polic e, he did not fear society, he did not fear God, he did not \\nfear hell, he did not fear or  love his fellow man. But he had elected, he had chosen, to \\nfear and love Don Corleone. Us hered into the presence of the Don, the terrible Brasi \\nheld himself stiff with respect. He stuttered over the flowery congatulations he offered \\nand his formal hope that the first grandchild  would be masculine. He then handed the \\nDon an envelope stuffed with cash as  a gift for the bridal couple. \\nSo that was what he want ed to do. Hagen noticed the change in Don Corleone. The  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 16\\nDon received Brasi as a king greets a subj ect who has done him an enormous service, \\nnever familiar but with regal respect. With every gesture, with every word, Don Corleone \\nmade it clear to Luca Brasi that he was valued. Not for one moment did he show \\nsurprise at the wedding gift being pr esented to him personally. He understood. \\nThe money in the envelope was sure to be more than anyone else had given. Brasi had \\nspent many hours deciding on t he sum, comparing it to what the other guests might \\noffer. He wanted to be the most generous to show that he had the most respect, and \\nthat was why he had given his envelope to  the Don personally, a gaucherie the Don \\noverlooked in his own flowery sentence of t hanks. Hagen saw Luca Brasi’s face lose its \\nmask of fury, swell with pri de and pleasure. Bras i kissed the Don’s hand before he went \\nout the door that Hagen held open. Hagen prudently gave Br asi a friendly smile which \\nthe squat man acknowledged wi th a polite stretching of rubbery, veal-colored lips. \\nWhen the door closed Don Corleone gave a sma ll sigh of relief. Brasi was the only man \\nin the world who could make him nervous. T he man was like a natural force, not truly \\nsubject to control. He had to be handled as  gingerly as dynamit e. The Don shrugged. \\nEven dynamite could be exploded  harmlessly if the need arose.  He looked questioningly \\nat Hagen. “Is Bonasera the only one left?” \\nHagen nodded. Don Corleone fr owned in thought, then said, “Before you bring him in, \\ntell Santino to come here. He should learn some things.” \\nOut in the garden, Hagen searched anxiously for Sonny Corleone. He told the waiting \\nBonasera to be patient and went over to Mic hael Corleone and his girl friend. “Did you \\nsee Sonny around?” he asked. Michael shook  his head. Damn, Hagen thought, if Sonny \\nwas screwing the maid of honor all this time there was going to be a mess of trouble. His wife, the young girl’s family; it coul d be a disaster. Anxiously he hurried to the \\nentrance through which he had seen Sonny disappear almost a half hour ago. \\nSeeing Hagen go into the house,  Kay Adams asked Michael Co rleone, “Who is he? You \\nintroduced him as your brother but his name is different and he certainly doesn’t look Italian.” \\n“Tom lived with us since he wa s twelve years old,” Michael said. “His parents died and \\nhe was roaming around the str eets with this bad eye infect ion. Sonny brought him home \\none night and he just stayed. He  didn’t have anyplace to go. He lived with us until he got \\nmarried.” \\nKay Adams was thrilled. “That’s really rom antic,” she said. “Your father must be a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 17\\nwarmhearted person. To adopt so mebody just like that when he had so many children of \\nhis own.” \\nMichael didn’t bother to point out that immigrant Italians cons idered four children a small \\nfamily. He merely said, “Tom wasn’t adopted. He just lived with us.” \\n“Oh,” Kay said, then asked curiously, “why didn’t you adopt him?” \\nMichael laughed. “Because my father said it  would be disrespectfu l for Tom to change \\nhis name. Disrespectful to his own parents.” \\nThey saw Hagen shoo Sonny through the French door  into the Don’s office and then \\ncrook a finger at Amerigo Bonasera. “Why do they bother your fath er with business on a \\nday like this?” Kay asked. \\nMichael laughed again. “Because they know t hat by tradition no Sicilian can refuse a \\nrequest on his daughter’s wedding day. And no Sicilian ever lets a chance like that go \\nby.” \\n* * * \\nLucy Mancini lifted her pink gown off the floor and ran up the steps. Sonny Corleone’s \\nheavy Cupid face, redly obscene  with winey lust, frightened he r, but she had teased him \\nfor the past week to just this end. In her two college love affairs she had felt nothing and \\nneither of them lasted more  than a week. Quarreling, her second lover had mumbled \\nsomething about her being “too big down there.” Lucy had understood and for the rest of \\nthe school term had refused to go out on any dates. \\nDuring the summer, preparing for the wedding of her best friend, Connie Corleone, Lucy heard the whispered stories about Sonny. One Sunday afternoon in the Corleone \\nkitchen, Sonny’s wife Sandra gossiped fr eely. Sandra was a coarse, good-natured \\nwoman who had been born in Italy  but brought to America as a small child. She was \\nstrongly built with great breas ts and had already borne three ch ildren in five years of \\nmarriage. Sandra and the other women teased Connie about the terrors of the nuptial \\nbed. “My God,” Sandra had giggl ed, “when I saw that pole of Sonny’s for the first time \\nand realized he was going to stick it into me , I yelled bloody murder. After the first year \\nmy insides felt as mushy as macaroni boi led for an hour. When I heard he was doing the \\njob on other girls I went to  church and lit a candle.” \\nThey had all laughed but Lucy had felt her  flesh twitching between her legs. \\nNow as she ran up the steps toward Sonny a tremendous flash of desire went through  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 18\\nher body. On the landing Sonny grabbed her hand and pulled her down the hall into an \\nempty bedroom. Her legs went weak as th e door closed behind them. She felt Sonny’s \\nmouth on hers, his lips tasting of burnt tobacco, bitter. She opened her mouth. At that \\nmoment she felt his hand come  up beneath her bridesmaid’s gown, heard the rustle of \\nmaterial giving way, felt his large warm ha nd between her legs, ri pping aside the satin \\npanties to caress her vulva. She put her arms around his neck and hung there as he \\nopened his trousers. Then he placed both hands beneath her bare buttocks and lifted \\nher. She gave a little hop in t he air so that both her legs  were wrapped around his upper \\nthighs. His tongue was in her mo uth and she sucked on it. He gave a savage thrust that \\nbanged her head against the door.  She felt something burning pass between her thighs. \\nShe let her right hand drop from his neck and reached down to guide him. Her hand \\nclosed around an enormous, bl ood-gorged pole of muscle. It pulsated in her hand like \\nan animal and almost weeping wit h grateful ecstasy she poi nted it into her own wet, \\nturgid flesh. The thrust of its entering, the unbelievable pleasur e made her gasp, brought \\nher legs up almost around his neck, and t hen like a quiver, her body received the \\nsavage arrows of his lightning-li ke thrusts; innumerable, torturing; arching her pelvis \\nhigher and higher until for the first time in her life she reached a s hattering climax, felt \\nhis hardness break and then the crawly flood of semen over her  thighs. Slowly her legs \\nrelaxed from around his body , slid down until t hey reached the floor. They leaned \\nagainst each other, out of breath. \\nIt might have been going on for some time but now they could hear the soft knocking on \\nthe door. Sonny quickly buttoned his trousers, meanwhile blocking the door so that it \\ncould not be opened. Lucy frantic ally smoothed down her pink gown, her eyes flickering, \\nbut the thing that had given her so much plea sure was hidden inside sober black cloth. \\nThen they heard Tom Hagen’s voice, very low, “Sonny, you in there?” \\nSonny sighed with relief. He winked at  Lucy. “Yeah, Tom, what is it?” \\nHagen’s voice, still lo w, said, “The Don wants you in his office. Now.” They could hear \\nhis footsteps as he walked away. Sonny wa ited for a few moments, gave Lucy a hard \\nkiss on the lips, and then slipp ed out the door after Hagen. \\nLucy combed her hair. She checked her dre ss and pulled around her  garter straps. Her \\nbody felt bruised, her lips pulpy and tender. She went out  the door and though she felt \\nthe sticky wetness between her thighs she did not go to the bathroom to wash but ran \\nstraight on down the steps and into the garden. S he took her seat at the bridal table next \\nto Connie, who exclaimed petulantly, “Lucy, where were you? You look drunk. Stay  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 19\\nbeside me now.” \\nThe blond groom poured Lucy a glass of wine and smiled kn owingly. Lucy didn’t care. \\nShe lifted the grapey, dark red juice to her pa rched mouth and drank. She felt the sticky \\nwetness between her thighs and pressed her  legs together. Her body was trembling. \\nOver the glass rim, as she drank, her eyes  searched hungrily to find Sonny Corleone. \\nThere was no one else she cared to see. Slyl y she whispered in Conn ie’s ear, “Only a \\nfew hours more and you’ll know what it’s all about.” Connie gi ggled. Lucy demurely \\nfolded her hands on the table, treacherously tr iumphant, as if she had stolen a treasure \\nfrom the bride. \\n* * * \\nAmerigo Bonasera followed Hagen into the corner room of the house and found Don \\nCorleone sitting behind a huge desk. Sonny Corleone was standing by the window, \\nlooking out into the garden. For the first ti me that afternoon the Don behaved coolly. He \\ndid not embrace the visitor or shake ha nds. The sallow-faced undertaker owed his \\ninvitation to the fact that his wife and the wife of the Don were the closest of friends. \\nAmerigo Bonasera himself was in se vere disfavor with Don Corleone. \\nBonasera began his request obliquely and clev erly. “You must excuse my daughter, \\nyour wife’s goddaughter, fo r not doing your family the respec t of coming today. She is in \\nthe hospital still.” He glanced at Sonny Corl eone and Tom Hagen to indicate that he did \\nnot wish to speak before them . But the Don was merciless. \\n“We all know of your daughter’s misfortune,” Don Corleone said. “If I can help her in any \\nway, you have only to speak. My wife is her godmother after all. I have never forgotten \\nthat honor.” This was a rebuk e. The undertaker never calle d Don Corleone, “Godfather” \\nas custom dictated. \\nBonasera, ashen-faced, asked, direct ly now, “May I speak to you alone?” \\nDon Corleone shook his head. “I trust these tw o men with my life. They are my two right \\narms. I cannot insult them  by sending them away.” \\nThe undertaker closed his eyes for a mo ment and then began to speak. His voice was \\nquiet, the voice he used to console the bereaved.  “I raised my daughter  in the American \\nfashion. I believe in America. America has  made my fortune. I gave my daughter her \\nfreedom and yet taught her never to  dishonor her family. She found  a ‘boy friend,’ not an \\nItalian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. But he never came to \\nmeet her parents. I accepted al l this without a protest, the f ault is mine. Two months ago  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 20\\nhe took her for a drive. He had a masculi ne friend with him. They made her drink \\nwhiskey and then they tried to take advantag e of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. \\nThey beat her. Like an animal.  When I went to the hospital she had two black eyes. Her \\nnose was broken. Her jaw was shattered. They  had to wire it together . She wept through \\nher pain. ‘Father, Father, why did they do it? Why did they do this to me?’ And I wept.” \\nBonasera could not speak further, he was weeping now though his voice had not \\nbetrayed his emotion. \\nDon Corleone, as if against his will, made a gesture of sympathy and Bonasera went on, \\nhis voice human with suffering. “Why did I weep? She was the light  o f  m y  l i f e ,  a n  \\naffectionate daughter. A beautiful girl. She trus ted people and now s he will never trust \\nthem again. She will never be beaut iful again.” He was trembli ng, his sallow face flushed \\nan ugly dark red. \\n“I went to the police like a good American. The two boys were arrested. They were \\nbrought to trial. The evidenc e was overwhelming and they pleaded guilty. The judge \\nsentenced them to three year s in prison and suspended the sentence. They went free \\nthat very day. I stood in the courtroom lik e a fool and those bastards smiled at me. And \\nthen I said to my wife: ‘We must go to Don Corleone for justice.’ ” \\nThe Don had bowed his head to show respect for the man’s grief. But when he spoke, \\nthe words were cold with off ended dignity. “Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t \\nyou come to me at the begi nning of this affair?” \\nBonasera muttered almost inaudibly, “What do you want of me? Tell me what you wish. \\nBut do what I beg you to do.” There was something almost insolent in his words. \\nDon Corleone said gravely, “And what is that?” \\nBonasera glanced at Hagen and Sonny Corl eone and shook his head. The Don, still \\nsitting at Hagen’s desk, incli ned his body toward the under taker. Bonasera hesitated, \\nthen bent down and put his lips so  close to the Don’s hairy ear that they touched. Don \\nCorleone listened like a priest in the confessional, ga zing away into the distance, \\nimpassive, remote. They stood so for a long moment until Bonasera finished whispering \\nand straightened to his full height. The Don l ooked up gravely at Bonasera. Bonasera, \\nhis face flushed, returned the stare unflinchingly. \\nFinally the Don spoke. “That I can not do. You are being carried away.” \\nBonasera said loudly, clearly, “I will pay yo u anything you ask.” On hearing this, Hagen \\nflinched, a nervous flick of his head. Sonny Corleone folded his arms, smiled  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 21\\nsardonically as he turned from the window to watch the scene in the room for the first \\ntime. \\nDon Corleone rose from behind the desk. His fa ce was still impassive but his voice rang \\nlike cold death. “We have known each other many years, you and I,” he said to the \\nundertaker, “but until this day you never ca me to me for counsel or help. I can’t \\nremember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee though my wife is \\ngodmother to your only child. Let us be frank. You spurned my  friendship. You feared to \\nbe in my debt.” \\nBonasera murmured, “I didn’t want to get into trouble.” \\nThe Don held up his hand. “N o. Don’t speak. You found Am erica a paradise. You had a \\ngood trade, you made a good living,  you thought the world a harmless place where you \\ncould take your pleasure as you willed. You never armed yourself with true friends. After \\nall, the police guarded you, t here were courts of law, y ou and yours could come to no \\nharm. You did not need Don Corleone. Very we ll. My feelings we re wounded but I am \\nnot that sort of person why thrusts his fri endship on those who do not value it– on those \\nwho think me of little account.” The Don paus ed and gave the undertaker a polite, ironic \\nsmile. “Now you come to me and say, ‘Don Corleone give me justice.’ And you do not \\nask with respect. You do not offer me your fr iendship. You come into my home on the \\nbridal day of my daughter and you ask me to do murder and you say”–here the Don’s \\nvoice became a scornful mimicry–” ‘I will pa y you anything.’ No, no,  I am not offended, \\nbut what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?” \\nBonasera cried out in his anguish and his fear , “America has been good to me. I wanted \\nto be a good citizen. I wanted my child to be American.” \\nThe Don clapped his hands together with decis ive approval. “Well spoken. Very fine. \\nThen you have nothing to complain about. T he judge has ruled. America has ruled. \\nBring your daughter flow ers and a box of candy  when you go visit her  in the hospital. \\nThat will comfort her. Be content. After all, this is not a serious affair, the boys were young, high-spirited, and one of  them is the son of a power ful politician. No, my dear \\nAmerigo, you have always been honest. I must admit, though you spurned my \\nfriendship, that I would trust the given word of Amerigo Bonasera more than I would any \\nother man’s. So give me your word that you will put aside this madness. It is not \\nAmerican. Forgive. Forget. Life is full of misfortunes.” \\nThe cruel and contemptuous irony with which al l this was said, the controlled anger of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 22\\nthe Don, reduced the poor undertaker to a qui vering jelly but he spoke up bravely again. \\n“I ask you for justice.” \\nDon Corleone said curtly, “T he court gave you justice.” \\nBonasera shook his head stubbornl y. “No. They gave the youths justice. They did not \\ngive me justice.” \\nThe Don acknowledged this fine  distinction with an approving nod, then asked, “What is \\nyour justice?” \\n“An eye for an eye,” Bonasera said. \\n“You asked for more,” the Don sa id. “Your daughter is alive.” \\nBonasera said reluctantly, “Let  them suffer as she suffers.”  The Don waited for him to \\nspeak further. Bonasera screwed up the last of  his courage and said, “How much shall I \\npay you?” It was a despairing wail. \\nDon Corleone turned his back. It was a dismissal. Bonasera did not budge. \\nFinally, sighing, a good-hearted man who c annot remain angry wit h an erring friend, \\nDon Corleone turned back to  the undertaker, who was now as pale as one of his \\ncorpses. Don Corleone was gentle, patient. “Why do you fear to give your first \\nallegiance to me?” he said. “Y ou go to the law courts and wait for months. You spend \\nmoney on lawyers who know full well you are to be made a fool of. You accept judgment \\nfrom a judge who sells himself like the worst whore in the streets. Years gone by, when \\nyou needed money, you went to the banks and paid ruinous interest, waited hat in hand \\nlike a beggar while they sni ffed around, poked their noses up your very asshole to make \\nsure you could pay them back.” The Don paused, his voice became sterner. \\n“But if you had come to me, my purse woul d have been yours. If you had come to me for \\njustice those scum who ruined your daughter w ould be weeping bitter tears this day. If \\nby some misfortune an honest man like yourse lf made enemies they would become my \\nenemies”– the Don raised his arm, finger poin ting at Bonasera– “ and then, believe me, \\nthey would fear you.” \\nBonasera bowed his head and murmured in a str angled voice, “Be my friend. I accept.” \\nDon Corleone put his hand on the man’s shoulder. “Good,” he sa id, “you shall have your \\njustice. Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do me a service in return. Until that day, consider this ju stice a gift from my wife, your daughter’s \\ngodmother.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 23\\nWhen the door closed behind t he grateful undertaker, Don Corleone turned to Hagen \\nand said, “Give this affair to Clemenza and tell him to be sure to use reliable people, \\npeople who will not be carried away by the smell of blood. After all, we’re not murderers, \\nno matter what that corpse valet dreams up in his foolish head.” He noted that his \\nfirstborn, masculine son was gazing through the window at the garden party. It was \\nhopeless, Don Corleone thought. If he refused to  be instructed, Santino could never run \\nthe family business, could never become a D on. He would have to find somebody else. \\nAnd soon. After all, he was not immortal. \\nFrom the garden, startling al l three men, there came a happy roaring shout. Sonny \\nCorleone pressed close to the window. What he saw made him move quickly toward the \\ndoor, a delighted smile on his face. “It’s Johnny , he came to the wedding, what did I tell \\nyou?” Hagen moved to the window. “It’s really your godson,” he said to Don Corleone. “Shall I bring him here?” \\n“No,” the Don said. “Let the people enjoy him.  Let him come to me when he is ready.” \\nHe smiled at Hagen. “You see? He is a good godson.” \\nHagen felt a twinge of jealousy.  He said dryly, “It’s been tw o years. He’s probably in \\ntrouble again and wants you to help.” \\n“And who should he come to if not his godfather?” asked Don Corleone. \\n* * * \\nThe first one to see Johnny Fontane enter th e garden was Connie Co rleone. She forgot \\nher bridal dignity and scr eamed, “Johneee.” Then she ran into his arms. He hugged her \\ntight and kissed her on the mouth, kept his arm around her as others came up to greet \\nhim. They were all his old friends, people he  had grown up with on the West Side. Then \\nConnie was dragging him to her new husband.  Johnny saw with am usement that the \\nblond young man looked a little sour at no longer being the star of the day. He turned on \\nall his charm, shaking the groom’s hand,  toasting him with a glass of wine. \\nA familiar voice called from the bandstand, “How about giving us a song, Johnny?” He \\nlooked up and saw Nino Valenti smiling down at him. Johnny Fontane jumped up on the \\nbandstand and threw his arms around Nino.  They had been inseparable, singing \\ntogether, going out with girls together, until Johnny had started to become famous and \\nsing on the radio. When he  had gone to Hollyw ood to make movies  Johnny had phoned \\nNino a couple of times just to talk and had pr omised to get him a club singing date. But \\nhe had never done so. Seeing Nino now, his c heerful, mocking, drunken grin, all the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 24\\naffection returned. \\nNino began strumming on the mandolin. J ohnny Fontane put his hand on Nino’s \\nshoulder. “This is for the bride,” he said, and stamping his foot, chan ted the words to an \\nobscene Sicilian love song. As  he sang, Nino made suggestive motions with his body. \\nThe bride blushed proudly, t he throng of guests roared its approval. Before the song \\nended they were all stamping with their feet  and roaring out the sly, double-meaning tag \\nline that finished each stanza. At the end t hey would not stop applauding until Johnny \\ncleared his throat to sing another song. \\nThey were all proud of him.  He was of them and he had  become a famous singer, a \\nmovie star who slept with the most desired women in the world. And yet he had shown \\nproper respect for his Godfather by trave ling three thousand miles to attend this \\nwedding. He still loved old friends like Nino Valenti. Many of the people there had seen \\nJohnny and Nino singing together when they were  just boys, when no one dreamed that \\nJohnny Fontane would grow up to hold the hear ts of fifty million women in his hands. \\nJohnny Fontane reached down and lifted the bride up onto the bandstand so that \\nConnie stood between him and Nino. Both men crouched down, facing each other, Nino \\nplucking the mandolin for a fe w harsh chords. It was an old routine of theirs, a mock \\nbattle and wooing, using their voices like sw ords, each shouting a chorus in turn. With \\nthe most delicate courtesy, Johnny let Nino’s voice overwhelm his own, let Nino take the \\nbride from his arm, let Nino swing into the la st victorious stanza wh ile his own voice died \\naway. The whole wedding party broke into shouts of applause, the three of them \\nembraced each other at the end. The guests begged for another song. \\nOnly Don Corleone, standing in the corner entrance of the house, sensed something \\namiss. Cheerily, with bluff good humor, careful not to give offense to his guests, he \\ncalled out, “My godson has come three thous and miles to do us honor and no one thinks \\nto wet his throat?” At once a dozen full wineg lasses were thrust at Johnny Fontane. He \\ntook a sip from all and rus hed to embrace his Godfather. As he did so he whispered \\nsomething into the older man’s ear. Don Corleone led him into the house. \\nTom Hagen held out his hand when Johnny ca me into the room. Johnny shook it and \\nsaid, “How are you, Tom?” But without his usual charm that consisted of a genuine \\nwarmth for people. Hagen was a li ttle hurt by this coolness but shrugged it off. It was \\none of the penalties for being the Don’s hatchet man. \\nJohnny Fontane said to the Don, “When I got t he wedding invitation I said to myself, ‘My  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 25\\nGodfather isn’t mad at me anymore.’ I called  you five times after my divorce and Tom \\nalways told me you were out or busy so I knew you were sore.” \\nDon Corleone was filling glasse s from the yellow bo ttle of Strega. “That’s all forgotten. \\nNow. Can I do something for you still? You’re not too famous, too rich , that I can’t help \\nyou?” \\nJohnny gulped down the yellow fi ery liquid and held out his gl ass to be refilled. He tried \\nto sound jaunty. “I’m not rich, Godfather. I’ m going down. You were right. I should never \\nhave left my wife and kids for that tramp I ma rried. I don’t blame you for getting sore at \\nme.” \\nThe Don shrugged. “I worried about you,  you’re my godson, that’s all.” \\nJohnny paced up and down the room. “I was cra zy about that bitch. The biggest star in \\nHollywood. She looks like an angel. And you know what she does after a picture? If the \\nmakeup man does a good job on her face, s he lets him bang her. If the cameraman \\nmade her look extra good, she brings him into  her dressing room a nd gives him a screw. \\nAnybody. She uses her body like I use the loose change in my pocket for a tip. A whore \\nmade for the devil.” \\nDon Corleone curtly broke in. “How is your family?” \\nJohnny sighed. “I took care of them. Afte r the divorce I gave Ginny and the kids more \\nthan the courts said I should. I go see them once a week. I miss them. Sometimes I \\nthink I’m going crazy.” He took another drink.  “Now my second wife laughs at me. She \\ncan’t understand my being jealous. She ca lls me an old-fashioned guinea, she makes \\nfun of my singing. Before I le ft I gave her a nice beating but not in the face because she \\nwas making a picture. I gave her cramps, I punched her on the arms and legs like a kid \\nand she kept laughing at me.” He lit a cigarette. “So, Godf ather, right now, life doesn’t \\nseem worth living.” \\nDon Corleone said simply. “These are troubl es I can’t help you with.” He paused, then \\nasked, “What’s the matter with your voice?” \\nAll the assured charm, the self-mockery, di sappeared from Johnny Fontane’s face. He \\nsaid almost brokenly, “Godfather, I c an’t sing anymore, something happened to my \\nthroat, the doctors don’t know what.” Hagen and the Don looked at him with surprise, \\nJohnny had always been so  tough. Fontane went on. “My two pictures made a lot of \\nmoney. I was a big star. Now they throw me out. The head of the studio always hated \\nmy guts and now he’s paying me off.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 26\\nDon Corleone stood before his godson and ask ed grimly, “Why doesn’t this man like \\nyou?” \\n“I used to sing those songs for the liberal organizations, you know, all that stuff you \\nnever liked me to do. Well, Jack Woltz didn’ t like it either. He called me a Communist, \\nbut he couldn’t make it stick. Then I snat ched a girl he had saved for himself. It was \\nstrictly a one-night stand and she came afte r me. What the hell could I do? Then my \\nwhore second wife throws me out. And Ginny and the kids won’t take me back unless I \\ncome crawling on my hands and knees, and I can’t sing anymore. Godfather, what the \\nhell can I do?” \\nDon Corleone’s face had become cold wit hout a hint of sympathy. He said \\ncontemptuously, “You can start by acting like a man.” Suddenly anger contorted his \\nface. He shouted. “LIKE A MAN!” He reached over the desk and grabbed Johnny \\nFontane by the hair of his head in a gesture that was sav agely affectionate. “By Christ in \\nheaven, is it possible that you spent so much time in my presence and turned out no \\nbetter than this? A Hollywood finocchio who w eeps and begs for pity? Who cries out like \\na woman– ‘What shall I do? Oh, what shall I do?” \\nThe mimicry of the Don was so extraordinar y, so unexpected, that Hagen and Johnny \\nwere startled into laughter. Don Corleone wa s pleased. For a moment he reflected on \\nhow much he loved this godson. How would his own three sons have reacted to such a tongue-lashing? Santino would have sulked  and behaved badly for weeks afterward. \\nFredo would have been co wed. Michael would have giv en him a cold smile and gone \\nout of the house, not to  be seen for months. But Johnny, ah, what a fine chap he was, \\nsmiling now, gathering strengt h, knowing already the tr ue purpose of his Godfather. \\nDon Corleone went on. “You took the woman of  your boss, a man mo re powerful than \\nyourself, then you complain he won’t help you. What nonsense. Y ou left your family, \\nyour children without a father, to marry a whore and you weep because they don’t \\nwelcome you back with open arms. The whore, you don’t hit her in the face because she \\nis making a picture, then you are amazed bec ause she laughs at you. You lived like a \\nfool and you have come to a fool’s end.” \\nDon Corleone paused to ask in a patient voice, “Are  you willing to take my advice this \\ntime?” \\nJohnny Fontane shrugged. “I can’t marry Ginny again, not the way s he wants. I have to \\ngamble, I have to drink, I have to go out with the boys. Beautiful broads run after me and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 27\\nI never could resist them. Then I used to f eel like a heel when I went back to Ginny. \\nChrist, I can’t go through all that crap again.” \\nIt was rare that Don Corleon e showed exasperation. “I didn’t tell you to get married \\nagain. Do what you want. It’s good you wish to be a father to your  children. A man who \\nis not a father to his childre n can never be a real man. Bu t then, you must make their \\nmother accept you. Who says you can’t see them every day? Who says you can’t live in \\nthe same house? Who says you can’t live your life exactly as you want to live it?” \\nJohnny Fontane laughed. “Godfather, not all women are lik e the old Italian wives. Ginny \\nwon’t stand for it.” \\nNow the Don was mocking. “Because you act ed like a finocchio. You gave her more \\nthan the court said. You didn’t hit the othe r in the face because she was making a \\npicture. You let women dictate your actions and they are not competent in this world, \\nthough certainly they will be sain ts in heaven while we men burn in hell. An d then I’ve \\nwatched you all these years.” The Don’s voice became earnest. “You’ve been a fine \\ngodson, you’ve given me all the respect. But w hat of your other old friends? One year \\nyou run around with this person, the next year with another person. That Italian boy who \\nwas so funny in the movies, he had some bad luck and you never saw him again \\nbecause you were more famous. And how about your old, old comrade that you went to \\nschool with, who was your partner singi ng? Nino. He drinks too much out of \\ndisappointment but he never complains. He works hard dr iving the gravel truck and \\nsings weekends for a few dollars. He never says anything against you. You couldn’t help \\nhim a bit? Why not? He sings well.” \\nJohnny Fontane said with pati ent weariness, “Godfather, he just hasn’t got enough \\ntalent. He’s OK, but he’s not big time.” \\nDon Corleone lidded his eyes almost clos ed and then said, “And you, godson, you now, \\nyou just don’t have talent enough. Shall I get you a job on the gravel truck with Nino?” \\nWhen Johnny didn’t answer, the Don went on. “Friendship is  everything. Friendship is \\nmore than talent. It is more  than government. It is almost  the equal of family. Never \\nforget that. If you had built up a wall of friendships you wouldn’t have to ask me to help. \\nNow tell me, why can’t you sing? You sang we ll in the garden. As well as Nino.” \\nHagen and Johnny smiled at this delicate thrus t. It was Johnny’s turn to be patronizingly \\npatient. “My voice is weak. I sing one or tw o songs and then I can’t sing again for hours \\nor days. I can’t make it through the rehearsals or the retakes. My voice is weak, it’s got  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 28\\nsome sort of sickness.” \\n“So you have woman trouble. Yo ur voice is sick. Now tell me the trouble you’re having \\nwith this Hollywood pezzonovante who won’t let you work.” The Don was getting down \\nto business. \\n“He’s bigger than one of your pezzonovantes, ” Johnny said. “He owns the studio. He \\nadvises the President on movie propaganda for the war. Just a month ago he bought \\nthe movie rights to the biggest novel of the year. A best seller. And the main character is \\na guy just like me. I wouldn’t even have to act, just be myself. I wouldn’t even have to \\nsing. I might even win the Academy Award. Ev erybody knows it’s per fect for me and I’d \\nbe big again. As an actor. But that bastard Ja ck Woltz is paying me off, he won’t give it \\nto me. I offered to do it for nothing, for a minimum price and he still says no. He sent the \\nword that if I come and kiss his ass in the studio commissary, maybe he’ll think about it.” \\nDon Corleone dismissed this emotional n onsense with a wave of his hand. Among \\nreasonable men problems of business could al ways be solved. He patted his godson on \\nthe shoulder. “You’re discouraged. Nobody cares about you, so you think. And you’ve \\nlost a lot of weight. You drink a lot, eh? You don’t sleep and you take pills?” He shook \\nhis head disapprovingly. \\n“Now I want you to follow my orders,” the Don said. “I want you to stay in my house for \\none month. I want you to eat well, to rest and sleep. I want you to be my companion, I \\nenjoy your company, and maybe you can learn something ab out the world from your \\nGodfather that might even help you in the gr eat Hollywood. But no singing, no drinking \\nand no women. At the end of the month you can go back to Hollywood and this pezzonovante, this.90 caliber will gi ve you that job you want. Done?” \\nJohnny Fontane could not alto gether believe that the Don had such power. But his \\nGodfather had never said such and such a thing could be done wit hout having it done. \\n“This guy is a personal friend of J. Edgar Hoover,” Johnny  said. “You can’t even raise \\nyour voice to him.” \\n“He’s a businessman,” the Don said blandly.  “I’ll make him an offe r he can’t refuse.” \\n“It’s too late,” Johnny said. “All the contract s have been signed and they start shooting in \\na week. It’s absolutely impossible.” \\nDon Corleone said, “Go, go back to the party.  Your friends are waiting for you. Leave \\neverything to me.” He pushed Jo hnny Fontane out of the room.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 29\\nHagen sat behind the desk and made notes. The Don heaved a sigh and asked, “Is \\nthere anything else?” \\n“Sollozzo can’t be put off any more. You’ll have to see him this week.” Hagen held his \\npen over the calendar. \\nThe Don shrugged. “Now that the w edding is over, whenever you like.” \\nThis answer told Hagen two things. Most impor tant, that the answer to Virgil Sollozzo \\nwould be no. The second, that Don Corleone, since he would not gi ve the answer before \\nhis daughter’s wedding, expecte d his no to cause trouble. \\nHagen said cautiously, “Shall I tell Clemenza to have some men come live in the house?” \\nThe Don said impatiently, “For what? I didn’t answer before the wedding because on an important day like that there should be no cloud, not even in the distance. Also I wanted \\nto know beforehand what he wanted to talk  about. We know now. What he will propose \\nis an infamita.” \\nHagen asked, “Then you will refuse?” When the Don nodded, Hagen said, “I think we \\nshould all discuss it– the whole Fam ily– before you give your answer.” \\nThe Don smiled. “You think so? Good, we wi ll discuss it. When you come back from \\nCalifornia. I want you to fly there tomorro w and settle this business for Johnny. See that \\nmovie pezzonovante. Tell Sollozzo I will see hi m when you get back from California. Is \\nthere anything else?” \\nHagen said formally, “The hospital called. Consigliere Abbandando is dying, he won’t \\nlast out the night. His family was told to come and wait.” \\nHagen had filled the Consigliere’s post for t he past year, ever since the cancer had \\nimprisoned Genco Abbandando in his hospital bed. Now he waited to hear Don \\nCorleone say the post was his permanently. The odds  were against it. So  high a position \\nwas traditionally given only to a man desc ended from two Italian parents. There had \\nalready been trouble about his temporary performance of the duties. Also, he was only \\nthirty-five, not old enough, supposedly, to have acquired the necessary experience and \\ncunning for a successful Consigliere. \\nBut the Don gave him no encouragement. He asked, “When does my daughter leave \\nwith her bridegroom?” \\nHagen looked at his wristwatch . “In a few minutes they’ll cu t the cake and then a half  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 30\\nhour after that.” That reminded him of somethi ng else. “Your new son-in-law. Do we give \\nhim something important, inside the Family?” \\nHe was surprised at the vehem ence of the Don’s answer. “Never.” The Don hit the desk \\nwith the flat of his hand. “Nev er. Give him something to earn his living, a good living. But \\nnever let him know the Family’s business. Tell the others, Sonny, Fredo, Clemenza.” \\nThe Don paused. “Instruct my sons, all three of them, that they  will accompany me to \\nthe hospital to see poor Genco.  I want them to pay their last respects. Tell Freddie to \\ndrive the big car and ask Johnny if he will come with us, as a special favor to me.” He \\nsaw Hagen look at him questioni ngly. “I want you to go to California tonight. You won’t \\nhave time to go see Genco. But don’t leav e until I come back from the hospital and \\nspeak with you. Understood?” \\n“Understood,” Hagen said. “What time should Fred have the car waiting?” \\n“When the guests have left,” Don Corleone said. “Genco will wait for me.” \\n“The Senator called,” Hagen said. “Apologizi ng for not coming personally but that you \\nwould understand. He probably means those two FBI men across the street taking down \\nlicense numbers. But he sent his gift over by special messenger.” \\nThe Don nodded. He did not th ink it necessary to mention that he himself had warned \\nthe Senator not to come. “Did  he send a nice present?” \\nHagen made a face of impressed approval that was very strangely Italian on his \\nGerman-Irish features. “Antique s ilver, very valuable. The kids  can sell it for a grand at \\nleast. The Senator spent a lot of  time getting exactly the right  thing. For those kind of \\npeople that’s more important than how much it costs.” \\nDon Corleone did not hide his pleasure that so great a man as the Senator had shown \\nhim such respect. The Senator, like Luca Brasi,  was one of the great stones in the Don’s \\npower structure, and he t oo, with this gift, had resworn his loyalty. \\n* * * \\nWhen Johnny Fontane appeared in the gar den, Kay Adams recognized him \\nimmediately. She was truly surprised. “You never told me your family knew Johnny \\nFontane,” she said. “Now I’m sure I’ll marry you.” \\n“Do you want to meet him?” Michael asked. \\n“Not now,” Kay said. She sighed . “I was in love with him for three years. I used to come  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 31\\ndown to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off. He was so \\nwonderful.” \\n“We’ll meet him later,” Michael said. \\nWhen Johnny finished singing an d vanished into the house with Don Corleone, Kay said \\narchly to Michael, “Don’t tell me a big movie star like Johnny Fontane has to ask your \\nfather for a favor?” \\n“He’s my father’s godson,” Michael said. “And if  it wasn’t for my father he might not be a \\nbig movie star today.” \\nKay Adams laughed with delight. “That sounds like another great story.” \\nMichael shook his head “I c an’t tell that one,” he said. \\n“Trust me,” she said. \\nHe told her. He told her without being funny. He told it without pride. He told it without \\nany sort of explanation except that eight years before his father had been more impetuous, and because the matter concerned his godson, the Don considered it an \\naffair of personal honor. \\nThe story was quickly told. Eight year s ago Johnny Fontane had made an extraordinary \\nsuccess singing with a popular dance band. He had become a top radio attraction. \\nUnfortunately the band leader, a well-kno wn show business personality named Les \\nHalley, had signed Johnny to a five-year pe rsonal services contract. It was a common \\nshow business practice. Les Halley could now loan Johnny out and pocket most of the \\nmoney. \\nDon Corleone entered the negot iations personally. He offered Les Halley twenty \\nthousand dollars to release Johnny Fontane from  the personal services contract. Halley \\noffered to take only fifty percent of Johnny’s earnings. Don Corleone was amused. He \\ndropped his offer from twenty thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars. The band leader, \\nobviously not a man of the world outside his beloved show business, completely missed \\nthe significance of this lower offer. He refused. \\nThe next day Don Corleone we nt to see the band leader personally. He brought with \\nhim his two best friends, Genco Abbandando, w ho was his Consigliere, and Luca Brasi. \\nWith no other witnesses Don Corleone persuaded Les Halley to sign a document giving \\nup all rights to all services from Johnny Fontane upon payment of a certified check to \\nthe amount of ten thousand dollars. Don Corleone did this by putting a pistol to the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 32\\nforehead of the band leader and assu ring him with the utmost se riousness that either his \\nsignature or his brains would rest on that do cument in exactly on e minute. Les Halley \\nsigned. Don Corleone pocketed his pistol  and handed over the certified check. \\nThe rest was history. Johnny Fontane went on to become the greatest singing sensation \\nin the country. He made Hollywood musicals that earned a fortune for his studio. His \\nrecords made millions of dollars. Then he divorced his childhood- sweetheart wife and \\nleft his two children, to marry the most glamor ous blond star in motion pictures. He soon \\nlearned that she was a “whore.” He drank, he gambled, he chased other  women. He lost \\nhis singing voice. His records stopped selling.  The studio did not renew his contract. \\nAnd so now he had come back to his Godfather. \\nKay said thoughtfully, “Are you sure you’re not  jealous of your father? Everything you’ve \\ntold me about him shows him doing some thing for other people. He must be \\ngoodhearted.” She smiled wryly. “Of course his methods are not exactly constitutional.” \\nMichael sighed. “I guess that’s the way it sounds, but let me tell you this. You know \\nthose Arctic explorers who leave caches of food scatter ed on the route to the North \\nPole? Just in case they may need them someday? That’s my father’s favors. Someday \\nhe’ll be at each one of those people’s houses and they had better come across.” \\n* * * \\nIt was nearly twilight before the wedding cake was shown, exclaimed over and eaten. \\nSpecially baked by Nazorine, it was cleverly decorated with shells of cream so \\ndizzyingly delicious that the bride greedily plucked them fr om the corpse of the cake \\nbefore she whizzed away on her honeymoon with her blond groom.  The Don politely \\nsped his guests’ departure, noting meanwhile that the black sedan with its FBI men was \\nno longer visible. \\nFinally the only car left in the driveway was the long black Cadillac with Freddie at the wheel. The Don got into the front seat, moving with quick coordination for his age and \\nbulk. Sonny, Michael and John ny Fontane got into the back seat. Don Corleone said to \\nhis son Michael, “Your girl fr iend, she’ll get back to the city by herself all right?” \\nMichael nodded. “Tom said he’d take care of  it.” Don Corleone nodded with satisfaction \\nat Hagen’s efficiency. \\nBecause of the gas rationing still in effect, th ere was little traffic on the Belt Parkway to \\nManhattan. In less than an hour the Cadillac roll ed into the street of French Hospital. \\nDuring the ride Don Corleone asked his younges t son if he was doing  well in school.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 33\\nMichael nodded. Then Sonny in the back s eat asked his father, “Johnny says you’re \\ngetting him squared away with that Hollywood bus iness. Do you want me to go out there \\nand help?” \\nDon Corleone was curt. “Tom is going tonigh t. He won’t need any help, it’s a simple \\naffair.” \\nSonny Corleone laughed. “Johnny thinks you can’ t fix it, that’s why I thought you might \\nwant me to go out there.” \\nDon Corleone turned his head.  “Why do you doubt me?” he asked Johnny Fontane. \\n“Hasn’t your Godfather always done what he said he would do? Have I ever been taken \\nfor a fool?” \\nJohnny apologized nervously. “G odfather, the man who runs it is a real.90 caliber \\npezzonovante. You can’t budge him, not even with money. He has big connections. And \\nhe hates me. I just don’t know how you can swing it.” \\nThe Don spoke with affectionate amusement. “I  say to you: you shall have it.” He \\nnudged Michael with his elbow. “We won’ t disappoint my godson, eh, Michael?” \\nMichael, who never doubted his father  for a moment, shook his head. \\nAs they walked toward the hospital entranc e, Don Corleone put his hand on Michael’s \\narm so that the others forged ahead. “When you get through with co llege, come and talk \\nto me,” the Don said. “I have some plans you will like.” \\nMichael didn’t say anything. Don Corleone gr unted in exasperation. “I know how you \\nare. I won’t ask you to do anything you don’t approve of. This is something special. Go your own way now, you’re a man after all. But come to me as a son should when you \\nhave finished with your schooling.” \\n* * *  \\nThe family of Genco Abbandando , wife and three daughters dr essed in black, clustered \\nlike a flock of plump crows on the white tile fl oor of the hospital corridor. When they saw \\nDon Corleone come out of the el evator, they seemed to flutter up off the white tiles in an \\ninstinctive surge toward him fo r protection. The mother was regally stout in black, the \\ndaughters fat and plain. Mrs. Abbandando pecked at Don Corl eone’s cheek, sobbing, \\nwailing, “Oh, what a saint you are, to  come here on your daught er’s wedding day.” \\nDon Corleone brushed these t hanks aside. “Don’t I owe respect to such a friend, a \\nfriend who has been my right arm for twent y, years?” He had understood immediately  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 34\\nthat the soon-to-be widow did not compreh end that her husband would die this night. \\nGenco Abbandando had been in this hospital for nearly a year dying of his cancer and \\nthe wife had come to consider his fatal illne ss almost an ordinary part of life. Tonight \\nwas just another crisis. S he babbled on. “Go in and see my poor husband,” she said, \\n“he asks for you. Poor man, he wanted to come  to the wedding to show his respect but \\nthe doctor would not permit it. Then he said you would come to see him on this great \\nday but I did not believe it possible. Ah, men understand friendship more than we \\nwomen. Go inside, you will make him happy.” \\nA nurse and a doctor came out  of Genco Abbandando’s privat e room. The doctor was a \\nyoung man, serious-faced and with the air of one born to command, that is to say, the air of one who has been immensely rich all hi s life. One of the daughters asked timidly, \\n“Dr. Kennedy, can we go to see him now?” \\nDr. Kennedy looked over the la rge group with exasperation. Didn’t these people realize \\nthat the man inside was dyin g and dying in torturous pain? It would be much better if \\neveryone let him die in peace. “I think just  the immediate family,” he said in his \\nexquisitely polite voice. He was surpris ed when the wife and da ughters turned to the \\nshort, heavy man dressed in an awkwardly fitted tuxedo, as if to hear his decision. \\nThe heavy man spoke. There was just the s lightest trace of an Italian accent in his \\nvoice. “My dear doctor,” said Don Co rleone, “is it true he is dying?” \\n“Yes,” said Dr. Kennedy. \\n“Then there is nothing more for you to do,” said Don Corleone. “We will take up the \\nburden. We will comfort him. We will close his eyes. We will bury him and weep at his \\nfuneral and afterwards we will watch over his wife and daughters.” At hearing things put \\nso bluntly, forcing her to understand, Mrs. Abbandando began to weep. \\nDr. Kennedy shrugged. It was impossible to explain to these peasants . At the same time \\nhe recognized the crude justice in the man’s rema rks. His role was over. Still exquisitely \\npolite, he said, “Please wait for the nurse to let you in, she has a few necessary things to \\ndo with the patient.” He walked away fr om them down the corridor, his white coat \\nflapping. \\nThe nurse went back into the room and they waited. Finally she came out again, holding \\nthe door for them to enter. S he whispered, “He’s delirious wit h the pain and fever, try not \\nto excite him. And you can stay only a few minutes, except for the wife.” She recognized Johnny Fontane as he went by her and her ey es opened wide. He gave her a faint smile  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 35\\nof acknowledgment and she stared at him with frank invitati on. He filed her away for \\nfuture reference, then followed t he others into the sick man’s room. \\nGenco Abbandando had run a long race with death, and now, vanquished, he lay \\nexhausted on the raised bed. He was wasted away to no more than a skeleton, and \\nwhat had once been vigorous black hair had turned into obscene stringy wisps. Don \\nCorleone said cheerily, “Genco, dear fri end, I have brought my sons to pay their \\nrespects, and look, even Johnny, all the way from Hollywood.” \\nThe dying man raised his fever ed eyes gratefully to the Don. He let the young men clasp \\nhis bony hand in their fleshy ones. His wi fe and daughters ranged themselves along his \\nbed, kissing his cheek, taking his other hand in turn. \\nThe Don pressed his old friend’s hand. He sa id comfortingly, “Hurry up and get better \\nand we’ll take a trip back to Ita ly together to our old village. We’ll play boccie in front of \\nthe wineshop like our fathers before us.” \\nThe dying man shook his head.  He motioned the young men and his family away from \\nhis bedside; with the other bony claw he hung fast  to the Don. He tried to speak. The \\nDon put his head down  and then sat on the bedside chair. Genco Abbandando was \\nbabbling about their ch ildhood. Then his coal-black eyes  became sly. He whispered. \\nThe Don bent closer. The others in the room were astonished  to see tears running down \\nDon Corleone’s face as he shook  his head. The quaver ing voice grew lo uder, filling the \\nroom. With a tortured, superhuman effor t, Abbandando lifted his head off his pillow, \\neyes unseeing, and pointed a skeletal forefi nger at the Don. “Godfa ther, Godfather,” he \\ncalled out blindly, “save me fr om death, I beg of you. My fl esh is burning off my bones \\nand I can feel the worms eating away my br ain. Godfather, cure me, you have the \\npower, dry the tears of my poor wife. In Corleone we played together as children and \\nnow will you let me die when I fear hell for my sins?” \\nThe Don was silent. Abbandando said, “It is your daughter’s wedding day, you cannot \\nrefuse me.” \\nThe Don spoke quietly, gravely, to pierce  through the blasphemous delirium. “Old \\nfriend,” he said, “I have no such powers. If I did I would be more merciful than God, \\nbelieve me. But don’t fear death and don’t fear hell. I will have a mass said for your soul \\nevery night and every morning. Your wife and y our children will pray for you. How can \\nGod punish you with so many pleas for mercy?” \\nThe skeleton face took on a cunning expr ession that was obscene. Abbandanda said  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 36\\nslyly, “It’s been arranged then?” \\nWhen the Don answered, his voice was cold, without comfort. “You blaspheme. Resign \\nyourself.” \\nAbbandando fell back on the pillow. His eyes lost their wild gleam of hope. The nurse \\ncame back into the room and started shooing t hem out in a very matter-of-fact way. The \\nDon got up but Abbandando put out his hand. “Godfather,” he said, “stay here with me \\nand help me meet death. Per haps if He sees you near me He will be frightened and \\nleave me in peace. Or perhaps you can say a word, pull a few strings, eh?” The dying \\nman winked as if he were mocking the Don, now  not really serious. “You’re brothers in \\nblood, after all.” Then, as if fearing the Don would be offended, he clutched at his hand. \\n“Stay with me, let me hold your hand. We’l l outwit that bastard as we’ve outwitted \\nothers. Godfather, don’t betray me.” \\nThe Don motioned the other people out of the room. They le ft. He took the withered \\nclaw of Genco Abbandando in his own two broad hands. So ftly, reassuringly, he \\ncomforted his friend, as they waited for death together. As if  the Don could truly snatch \\nthe life of Gencp Abbandando back from that mo st foul and criminal  traitor to man. \\n* * *  \\nThe wedding day of Connie Corleone ended we ll for her. Carlo Rizzi performed his \\nduties as a bridegroom with skill  and vigor, spurred on by the contents of the bride’s gift \\npurse which totaled up to over twenty thou sand dollars. The bride, however, gave up her \\nvirginity with a great deal more willingness than she gave up her purse. For the latter, he \\nhad to blacken one of her eyes. \\nLucy Mancini waited in her house for a call fr om Sonny Corleone, sure that he would \\nask her for a date. Finally she called hi s house and when she heard a woman’s voice \\nanswer the phone she hung up. She had no way of knowing that nearly everyone at the \\nwedding had remarked the absence of her and Sonny for that fatal half hour and the \\ngossip was already spreading that Santino Corleone had found another victim. That he \\nhad “done the job” on his own sister’s maid of honor. \\nAmerigo Bonasera had a terri ble nightmare. In his dream s he saw Don Corleone, in \\npeaked cap, overalls and heavy gloves, unloading  bullet-riddled corpses in front of his \\nfuneral parlor and shouting, “Remember, Ameri go, not a word to anyone, and bury them \\nquickly.” He groaned so loud and long in his sleep that his wife shook him awake. “Eh, \\nwhat a man you are,” she gr umbled. “To have a nightmare only after a wedding.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 37\\nKay Adams was escorted to her New York Cit y hotel by Paulie Gatto and Clemenza. \\nThe car was large, luxurious and driven by Gatto. Clemenz a sat in the back seat and \\nKay was given the front seat next to the driver. She found both men wildly exotic. Their \\nspeech was movie Brooklynese and they treated her with exagger ated courtliness. \\nDuring the ride she chatted cas ually with both men and was surprised when they spoke \\nof Michael with unmistakable affection and re spect. He had led her to believe that he \\nwas an alien in his father’s world. Now Clemenza was assuring her in his wheezing \\nguttural voice that the “old man” thought Mi ke was the best of his sons, the one who \\nwould surely inherit the family business. \\n“What business is that?” Kay a sked in the most natural way. \\nPaulie Gatto gave her a quick glance as he turned the wheel. Behind her Clemenza said \\nin a surprised voice. “Didn’t Mike tell you? Mr. Corleone is the biggest importer of Italian \\nolive oil in the St ates. Now that the war is  over the business coul d get real rich. He’ll \\nneed a smart boy like Mike.” \\nAt the hotel Clemenza insisted on coming to  the desk with her. W hen she protested, he \\nsaid simply, “The boss said to make sure you got home OK. I gotta do it.” \\nAfter she received her room ke y he walked her to the elevat or and waited until she got \\nin. She waved to him, smiling, and was surp rised at his genuine smile of pleasure in \\nreturn. It was just as well she did not see him go back to the hotel clerk and ask, “What \\nname she registered under?” \\nThe hotel clerk looked at Clemenza coldly . Clemenza rolled the little green spitball he \\nwas holding in his hand across to the clerk,  who picked it up and immediately said, “Mr. \\nand Mrs. Michael Corleone.” \\nBack in the car, Paulie Gatto said, “Nice dame.” \\nClemenza grunted. “Mike is doing the job on her.” Unless, he thought, they were really \\nmarried. “Pick me up early in the morning, ” he told Paulie Gatto. “Hagen got some deal \\nfor us that gotta be done right away.” \\n* * *  \\nIt was late Sunday night before Tom Hagen c ould kiss his wife good-bye and drive out \\nto the airport. With his special number one priority (a grateful gift from a Pentagon staff \\ngeneral officer) he had no trouble getting on a plane to Los Angeles. \\nIt had been a busy but satisfying day for Tom Hagen. Genco Abbandando had died at  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 38\\nthree in the morning and when Don Corleone returned from the hospital, he had \\ninformed Hagen that he was now officially the new Consigliere to the family. This meant \\nthat Hagen was sure to become a very rich man, to say nothing of power. \\nThe Don had broken a long- standing tradition. The Consigliere was always a \\nfull-blooded Sicilian,  and the fact that Hagen had been brought up as a member of the \\nDon’s family made no difference to that tradition. It was a question of blood. Only a Sicilian born to the ways of orme rta, the law of silence, coul d be trusted in the key post \\nof Consigliere. Between the head of the fa mily, Don Corleone, who dictated policy, and \\nthe operating level of men who actually carried out the order s of the Don, there were \\nthree layers, or buffers. In that way nothi ng could be traced to the top. Unless the \\nConsigliere turned traitor. That Sunday morni ng Don Corleone gave ex plicit instructions \\non what should be done to the two young men who had beaten the daughter of Amerigo \\nBonasera. But he had given th ose orders in private to Tom Hagen. Later in the day \\nHagen had, also in private wi thout witnesses, instructed Clemenza. In turn Clemenza \\nhad told Paulie Gatto to execute the commi ssion. Paulie Gatto would now muster the \\nnecessary manpower and execute the orders. Paulie Gatto and his men would not know \\nwhy this particular task was being carried out or  who had ordered it originally. Each link \\nof the chain would have to turn traitor fo r the Don to be involved and though it had never \\nyet happened, there was always the possibility. The cure for that possibility also was \\nknown. Only one link in the chain had to disappear. \\nThe Consigliere was also what  his name implied. He was t he counselor to the Don, his \\nright-hand man, his auxiliary br ain. He was also his closest companion and his closest \\nfriend. On important trips he would drive the Don’s car, at  conferences he would go out \\nand get the Don refreshments, coffee and s andwiches, fresh cigars. He would know \\neverything the Don knew or ne arly everything, all the cells  of power. He was the one \\nman in the world who could bring the Don crashing down  to destruction. But no \\nConsigliere had ever betrayed a Don, not in the memory of any of the powerful Sicilian \\nfamilies who had established themselves in America. There was no future in it. And \\nevery Consigliere knew that if he kept the faith, he would become rich, wield power and \\nwin respect. If misfortune came, his wife and children would be sheltered and cared for \\nas if he were alive or fr ee. If he kept the faith. \\nIn some matters the Consigliere had to act for his Don in a more open way and yet not \\ninvolve his principal. Hagen was flying to Calif ornia on just such a matter. He realized \\nthat his career as Consiglier e would be seriously affected by the success or failure of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 39\\nthis mission. By family business standards w hether Johnny Fontane got  his coveted part \\nin the war movie, or did no t, was a minor matter. Far more  important was the meeting \\nHagen had set up with Virgil Sollozzo the fo llowing Friday. But Hagen knew that to the \\nDon, both were of equal importance, which settled the matter for any good Consigliere. \\nThe piston plane shook Tom Hagen’s already nervous insides and he ordered a martini \\nfrom the hostess to quiet them. Both th e Don and Johnny had briefed him on the \\ncharacter of the movie producer, Jack Woltz.  From everything that Johnny said, Hagen \\nknew he would never be able to persuade Wolt z. But he also had no doubt whatsoever \\nthat the Don would keep his promise to Johnny . His own role was that of negotiator and \\ncontact. \\nLying back in his seat, Hagen went over all the information given to him that day. Jack \\nWoltz was one of the three most  important movie producers in Hollywood, owner of his \\nown studio with dozens of stars under contract . He was on the Presi dent of the United \\nStates’ Advisory Council for War Information,  Cinematic Division, which meant simply \\nthat he helped make propaganda mo vies. He had had dinner at the White House. He \\nhad entertained J. Edgar Hoover in his Hollywood home. But none of this was as \\nimpressive as it sounded. They were all official relationships. Woltz didn’t have any \\npersonal political power, mainly because he was an extreme reactionary, partly because \\nhe was a megalomaniac who loved to wield power wildly without  regard to the fact that \\nby so doing legions of enemie s sprang up out of the ground. \\nHagen sighed. There would be no  way to “handle” Jack Woltz. He opened his briefcase \\nand tried to get some paper work  done, but he was too tired. He ordered another martini \\nand reflected on his life. He had no regrets, indeed he felt that he had been extremely \\nlucky. Whatever the reason, the course he had chosen t en years ago had proved to be \\nright for him. He was successful, he was as happy as any grown man could reasonably expect, and he found life interesting. \\nTom Hagen was thirty-five years old, a ta ll crew-cut man, very slender, very \\nordinary-looking. He was a la wyer but did not do the actual detailed legal work for the \\nCorleone family business though  he had practiced law for three years after passing the \\nbar exam. \\nAt the age of eleven he had been a playmate of eleven-year-old Sonny Corleone. Hagen’s mother had gone blind and then died during his elev enth year. Hagen’s father, \\na heavy drinker, had become a hopeless drunk ard. A hardworking carpenter, he had  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 40\\nnever done a dishonest thing in his life. But his drinking destroyed his family and finally \\nkilled him. Tom Hagen was left an orphan who wandered the streets and slept in \\nhallways. His younger sister had been put in a foster home, but  in the 1920’s the social \\nagencies did not follow up cases of eleven-yea r-old boys who were so ungrateful as to \\nrun from their charity. Hagen, too, had an eye infection. Ne ighbors whispered that he \\nhad caught or inherited it from  his mother and so therefore it  could be caught from him. \\nHe was shunned. Sonny Corleone, a warmhear ted and imperious eleven-year-old, had \\nbrought his friend home and dem anded that he be taken in. Tom Hagen was given a hot \\ndish of spaghetti with oily rich tomato sauc e, the taste of which he had never forgotten, \\nand then given a metal folding bed to sleep on. \\nIn the most natural way, without a word being spoken or the matter discussed in any \\nfashion, Don Corleone had permitted the boy to  stay in his household. Don Corleone \\nhimself took the boy to a special doctor and had his eye infection cured. He sent him to \\ncollege and law school. In all this the Don act ed not as a father but rather as a guardian. \\nThere was no show of affection but  oddly enough the Don treated Hagen more \\ncourteously than his own sons, did not impose a parental will upon him. It was the boy’s \\ndecision to go to law school after college. He had heard Don Corleone say once, “A \\nlawyer with his briefcase can steal mo re than a hundred men with guns.” Meanwhile, \\nmuch to the annoyance of their father, So nny and Freddie insisted on going into the \\nfamily business after graduation from high school . Only Michael had gone on to college, \\nand he had enlisted in the Marines  the day after Pearl Harbor. \\nAfter he passed the bar exam, Hagen married to  start his own family. The bride was a \\nyoung Italian girl from New Jersey, rare at t hat time for being a co llege graduate. After \\nthe wedding, which was of c ourse held in the home of Don Corleone, the Don offered to \\nsupport Hagen in any undertaking he desired, to send him law clients, furnish his office, \\nstart him in real estate. \\nTom Hagen had bowed his head and said to the Don, “I would like to work for you.” \\nThe Don was surprised, yet pleased. “You know who I am?” he asked. \\nHagen nodded. He hadn’t really known the extent  of the Don’s power,  not then. He did \\nnot really know in the ten years that fo llowed until he was made the acting Consigliere \\nafter Genco Abbandando became ill. But he nodded and met the Don’s eyes with his own. “I would work for you like your sons,”  Hagen said, meaning wit h complete loyalty, \\nwith complete acceptance of the Don’s parental divinity. Th e Don, with that  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 41\\nunderstanding which was even t hen building the lege nd of his greatness, showed the \\nyoung man the first mark of fatherly affect ion since he hadcome into his household. He \\ntook Hagen into his arms fo r a quick embrace and afterward treated him more like a true \\nson, though he would sometimes say, “Tom, never  forget your parents, ” as if he were \\nreminding himself as well as Hagen. \\nThere was no chance that Hagen would forg et. His mother had been near moronic and \\nslovenly, so ridden by anemia she could not f eel affection for her children or make a \\npretense of it. His father Hagen had hated. His mother’s blindness before she died had \\nterrified him and his own eye infection had been a stroke of doom. He had been sure he \\nwould go blind. When his father died, Tom Hagen’s elev en-year-old mind had snapped \\nin a curious way. He had roamed the streets like an animal waiti ng for death until the \\nfateful day Sonny found him sleeping in t he back of a hallway and brought him to his \\nhome. What had happened afterward was a mira cle. But for years Hagen had had \\nnightmares, dreaming he had grown to manhood blind, tapping a whit e cane, his blind \\nchildren behind him tap-tapping with their little white canes as they begged in the \\nstreets. Some mornings when he woke the face of Don Corleone was imprinted on his \\nbrain in that first conscious moment and he would feel safe. \\nBut the Don had insisted that he put in three y ears of general law practice in addition to \\nhis duties for the family business. This ex perience had proved invaluable later on, and \\nalso removed any doubts in Hagen’s mind a bout working for Don Corleone. He had then \\nspent two years of training in the offices of a top firm of cr iminal lawyers in which the \\nDon had some influence. It was apparent to ever yone that he had a flair for this branch \\nof the law. He did well and when  he went into the full-time service of the family business, \\nDon Corleone had not been able to reproach him once in the six years that followed. \\nWhen he had been made the acting C onsigliere, the other powerful Sicilian families \\nreferred contemptuously to the Corleone fam ily as the “Irish gang.” This had amused \\nHagen. It had also taught him that he could never hope to succeed the Don as the head \\nof the family business. But he was cont ent. That had never been his goal, such an \\nambition would have been a “disrespect” to his benefactor and his benefactor’s blood \\nfamily. \\n* * *  \\nIt was still dark when the plane landed in Los  Angeles. Hagen checked into his hotel, \\nshowered and shaved, and watched dawn come over  the city. He ordered breakfast and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 42\\nnewspapers to be sent up to his room and re laxed until it was time for his ten A.M. \\nappointment with Jack Woltz.  The appointment had been surprisingly easy to make. \\nThe day before, Hagen had called the most powerful man in the movie labor unions, a \\nman named Billy Goff. Acting on instructions from Don Corleone, Hagen had told Goff to \\narrange an appointment on the next day for Hagen  to call on Jack Woltz, that he should \\nhint to Woltz that if Hagen was not made happy by the result s of the interview, there \\ncould be a labor strike at the movie studi o. An hour later Hagen received a call from \\nGoff. The appointment would be  at ten A.M. Woltz had go tten the message about the \\npossible labor strike but hadn’t seemed too impressed, Goff sa id. He added, “If it really \\ncomes down to that, I gotta talk to the Don myself.” \\n“If it comes to that he’ll talk to you,” Hagen said. By saying this he avoided making any \\npromises. He was not surprised that Go ff was so agreeable to the Don’s wishes. The \\nfamily empire, technically, did not extend beyond the New York area but Don Corleone \\nhad first become strong by helping labor leader s. Many of them still owed him debts of \\nfriendship. \\nBut the ten A.M. appointment was a bad sign. It meant that  he would be first on the \\nappointment list, that he would not be invited to lunch. It meant that Woltz held him in \\nsmall worth. Goff had not been threatening enough, probably because Woltz had him on \\nhis graft payroll. And sometimes the Don’ s success in keeping himself out of the \\nlimelight worked to the disadv antage of the family business,  in that his name did not \\nmean anything to outside circles. \\nHis analysis proved correct. Woltz kept him waiting for a half hour past the appointed \\ntime. Hagen didn’t mind. The reception room wa s very plush, very comfortable, and on a \\nplum-colored couch opposite him sat the most  beautiful child Hagen had ever seen. She \\nwas no more than eleven or twelve, dressed in  a very expensive but simple way as a \\ngrown woman. She had incredi bly golden hair, huge deep se a-blue eyes and a fresh \\nraspberry-red mouth. She was guarded by a wo man obviously her mother, who tried to \\nstare Hagen down with a cold arrogance that m ade him want to punch her in the face. \\nThe angel child and the dragon mother, Hagen thought, returning the mother’s cold \\nstare. \\nFinally an exquisitely dressed but stout middle-aged woman came to lead him through a \\nstring of offices to the offi ce-apartment of the movie pro ducer. Hagen was impressed by \\nthe beauty of the offices and th e people working in them. He  smiled. They were all  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 43\\nshrewdies, trying to get their foot in the movie door by taking office jobs; and most of \\nthem would work in these offices for the rest of their lives or until  they accepted defeat \\nand returned to their home towns. \\nJack Woltz was a tall, powerfully built man with a heavy paunch almost concealed by his perfectly tailored suit. Hagen knew his hist ory. At ten years of age Woltz had hustled \\nempty beer kegs and pushcarts on the East Si de. At twenty he helped his father sweat \\ngarment workers. At thirty he had left Ne w York and moved West, invested in the \\nnickelodeon and pioneered motion pictures. At forty-eight he had been the most \\npowerful movie magnate in Ho llywood, still rough-spoken,  rapaciously amorous, a \\nraging wolf ravaging helpless flocks of young st arlets. At fifty he transformed himself. He \\ntook speech lessons, learned how to dress from an Eng lish valet and how to behave \\nsocially from an English butler. When his fi rst wife died he married a world-famous and \\nbeautiful actress who didn’t lik e acting. Now at t he age of sixty he collected old master \\npaintings, was a member of the President ’s Advisory Committee, and had set up a \\nmultimillion-dollar foundation in  his name to promote art in  motion pictures. His daughter \\nhad married an English lord, his son an Italian princess. \\nHis latest passion, as reported dutifully by every movie columnist in America, was his \\nown racing stables on which he had spent ten million dollars in the past year. He had \\nmade headlines by purchasing the famed English racing horse Khartoum for the \\nincredible price of six hundred thousand dollars and then announcing that the \\nundefeated racer would be retired and put to stud exclusively for the Woltz stables. \\nHe received Hagen courteously, his beautifully, evenly tanned, meticulously barbered face contorted with a grimace meant to be a smile . Despite all the money spent, despite \\nthe ministrations of the most  knowledgeable technicians, his age showed; the flesh of \\nhis face looked as if it had been seamed toget her. But there was an enormous vitality in \\nhis movements and he had what Don Corle one had, the air of a man who commanded \\nabsolutely the world in which he lived. \\nHagen came directly to the point. That he wa s an emissary from a friend of Johnny \\nFontane. That this friend was a very power ful man who would pledge his gratitude and \\nundying friendship to Mr. Woltz if Mr. Woltz would grant a small favor. The small favor would be the casting of Johnny Fontane in the new war movie the studio planned to \\nstart next week. \\nThe seamed face was impassive , polite. “What favors can your friend do me?” Woltz  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 44\\nasked. There was just a trace of condescension in his voice. \\nHagen ignored the condescension. He expl ained. “You’ve got some labor trouble \\ncoming up. My friend can absolutely guarant ee to make that trouble disappear. You \\nhave a top male star who makes a lot of money for your studio but he just graduated \\nfrom marijuana to heroin. My friend will guarantee t hat your male star won’t be able to \\nget any more heroin. And if some other littl e things come up over the years a phone call \\nto me can solve your problems.” \\nJack Woltz listened to this as if he were hearing the boasting of a child. Then he said \\nharshly, his voice deliberately all East Side, “You trying to put muscle on me?” \\nHagen said coolly, “Absolutely no t. I’ve come to ask a service for a friend. I’ve tried to \\nexplain that you won’t lose anything by it.” \\nAlmost as if he willed it, Woltz made his face a mask of anger. The mouth curled, his \\nheavy brows, dyed black, contracted to form a thick line over his glinting eyes. He \\nleaned over the desk toward Hagen. “All right, y ou smooth son of a bitch,  let me lay it on \\nthe line for you and your boss,  whoever he is. Johnny Font ane never gets that movie. I \\ndon’t care how many guinea Mafia goombahs co me out of the woodwork.” He leaned \\nback. “A word of advice to you, my friend. J. Edgar Hoover, I assume you’ve heard of him”– Woltz smiled sardonically– “is a personal friend of mine. If I let him know I’m being \\npressured, you guys will never  know what hit you.” \\nHagen listened patiently. He  had expected better from a man of Woltz’s stature. Was it \\npossible that a man who acted this stupidly could rise to the head of a company worth \\nhundreds of millions? That was something to think about since the Don was looking for \\nnew things to put money into, and if the top br ains of this industry were so dumb, movies \\nmight be the thing. The abuse itself bothered him not at all. Hagen had  learned the art of \\nnegotiation from the Don himself. “Never get  angry,” the Don had instructed. “Never \\nmake a threat. Reason with people.” The word “reason” sounded so much better in \\nItalian, ragione, to rejoin. The art of this was to  ignore all insults, all threats; to turn the \\nother cheek. Hagen had seen the Don sit at  a negotiating table for eight hours, \\nswallowing insults, trying to persuade a notorious and m egalomaniac strong-arm man to \\nmend his ways. At the end of the eight hours  Don Corleone had thrown up his hands in \\na helpless gesture and said to the other m en at the table, “But  no one can reason with \\nthis fellow,” and had stalk ed out of the meeting room. The strong-arm man had turned \\nwhite with fear. Emissaries were sent to  bring the Don back into the room. An  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 45\\nagreement was reached but two months later the strong-arm was shot to death in his \\nfavorite barbershop. \\nSo Hagen started again,  speaking in the most  ordinary voice. “Look at my card,” he \\nsaid. “I’m a lawyer. Would I stick my neck ou t? Have I uttered one threatening word? Let \\nme just say that I am prepared to meet any condition you name to get Johnny Fontane \\nthat movie. I think I’ve already offered a great  deal for such a small favor. A favor that I \\nunderstand it would be in  your interest to grant. Johnny tells me that you admit he would \\nbe perfect for that part. And let me say that this favor would never be asked if that were \\nnot so. In fact, if you’re worried about your  investment, my client would finance the \\npicture. But please let me make myself absolutely clear. We under stand your no is no. \\nNobody can force you or is trying to. We kn ow about your friendship with Mr. Hoover, I \\nmay add, and my boss respects you for it. He  respects that relationship very much.” \\nWoltz had been doodling with a huge,  red-feathered pen. At t he mention of money his \\ninterest was aroused and he sto pped doodling. He said patronizingly, “This picture is \\nbudgeted at five million.” \\nHagen whistled softly to show that he was im pressed. Then he said very casually, “My \\nboss has a lot of friends who back his judgment.” \\nFor the first time Woltz seemed to take t he whole thing seriously. He studied Hagen’s \\ncard. “I never heard of you,” he said. “I know  most of the big lawyers in New York, but \\njust who the hell are you?” \\n“I have one of those di gnified corporate practices,” Hagen said dryly. “I just handle this \\none account.” He rose. “I won’t take up any more of your time.” He held out his hand, \\nWoltz shook it. Hagen took a few steps toward  the door and turned to  face Woltz again. \\n“I understand you have to deal with a lot of people who try to seem more important than \\nthey are. In my case the reverse is true.  Why don’t you check me out with our mutual \\nfriend? If you reconsider, call me at my ho tel.” He paused. “This may be sacrilege to \\nyou, but my client can do things for you that even Mr. Hoover might find out of his \\nrange.” He saw the movie pro ducer’s eyes narrowing. Woltz was finally getting the \\nmessage. “By the way, I admire your pictures very much,” Hagen said in the most \\nfawning voice he could manage. “I hope you can keep up the good work. Our country \\nneeds it.” \\nLate that afternoon Hagen received a call from the producer’s secretary that a car would \\npick him up within the hour to  take him out to Mr. Woltz’s country home for dinner. She  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 46\\ntold him it would be about a three-hour drive but that the car was equipped with a bar \\nand some hors d’oeuvres. Hagen knew that Wo ltz made the trip in his private plane and \\nwondered why he hadn’t bee n invited to make the trip by air. The secretary’s voice was \\nadding politely, “Mr. Woltz suggested you bring an overnight  bag and he’ll get you to the \\nairport in the morning.” \\n“I’ll do that,” Hagen said. That was another thing to wonder about. How did Woltz know \\nhe was taking the morning pla ne back to New York? He thought  about it for a moment. \\nThe most likely explanation was that Woltz had set private detectives on his trail to get \\nall possible information. Then Woltz certai nly knew he represented the Don, which \\nmeant that he knew somethi ng about the Don, which in turn meant that he was now \\nready to take the whole matter seriously. Something might be done after all, Hagen \\nthought. And maybe Woltz was smarter than he had appeared this morning. \\n* * *  \\nThe home of Jack Woltz looked like an implausible movie set. There was a \\nplantation-type mansion, huge grounds girdled by  a rich black-dirt bridle path, stables \\nand pasture for a herd of horses. The hedges , flower beds and grasses were as \\ncarefully manicured as a movie star’s nails. \\nWoltz greeted Hagen on a glass-paneled air-conditioned porch. The producer was \\ninformally dressed in blue silk  shirt open at the neck, mu stard-colored slacks, soft \\nleather sandals. Framed in al l this color and rich fabric his seamed, tough face was \\nstartling. He handed H agen an outsized martini glass and t ook one for himself from the \\nprepared tray. He seemed more friendly than he had been earlier in the day. He put his \\narm over Hagen’s shoulder and said, “We have a li ttle time before dinner, let’s go look at \\nmy horses.” As they walked toward the stables he said, “I checked you out, Tom; you \\nshould have told me your boss is Corleone. I thought you were just some third-rate \\nhustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. And I don’t bluff. Not that I want to make \\nenemies, I never believed in that. But let’s just enjoy ourselves now. We can talk \\nbusiness after dinner.” \\nSurprisingly Woltz proved to be a truly considerate host. He explained his new methods, innovations that he hoped woul d make his stable the most successful in America. The \\nstables were all fire-proofed, sanitized to the highest degree, and guarded by a special \\nsecurity detail of private detectives. Finally  Woltz led him to a stall which had a huge \\nbronze plaque attached to its outside wall . On the plaque was the name “Khartoum.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 47\\nThe horse inside the stall was, even to H agen’s inexperienced eyes, a beautiful animal. \\nKhartoum’s skin was jet black except fo r a diamond-shaped white patch on his huge \\nforehead. The great brown eyes glinted like golden apples, th e black skin over the taut \\nbody was silk. Woltz said with childish pride, “The greatest racehorse in the world. I \\nbought him in England last year for six hu ndred grand. I bet even the Russian Czars \\nnever paid that much for a sing le horse. But I’m not going to race him, I’m going to put \\nhim to stud. I’m going to build the greatest racing stable this country has ever known.” \\nHe stroked the horse’s mane and called out softly, “Khartoum, Khartoum.” There was \\nreal love in his voice and the animal res ponded. Woltz said to Hagen, “I’m a good \\nhorseman, you know, and the first time I ever  rode I was fifty years old.” He laughed. \\n“Maybe one of my grandmothers in Russia got raped by a Cossack and I got his blood.” \\nHe tickled Khartoum’s belly a nd said with sincere admiration,  “Look at that cock on him. \\nI should have such a cock.” \\nThey went back to the mansion to have dinner. It was served by three waiters under the command of a butler, the table linen and ware were all gold thread and silver, but Hagen \\nfound the food mediocre. Woltz obviously lived alone, and just as obviously was not a \\nman who cared about food. Ha gen waited until they had both lit up hu ge Havana cigars \\nbefore he asked Woltz, “Does  Johnny get it or not?” \\n“I can’t,” Woltz said. “I c an’t put Johnny into that picture even if I wanted to. The \\ncontracts are all signed for all the perfo rmers and the cameras roll next week. There’s \\nno way I can swing it.” \\nHagen said impatiently, “Mr. Woltz, the big advantage of dealing with a man at the top is \\nthat such an excuse is not valid. You can do  anything you want to do.” He puffed on his \\ncigar. “Don’t you believe my c lient can keep his promises?” \\nWoltz said dryly, “I believe that I’m goi ng to have labor trouble. Goff called me up on \\nthat, the son of a bitch, and the way he ta lked to me you’d never guess I pay him a \\nhundred grand a year under the tabl e. And I believe you can get that fag he-man star of \\nmine off heroin. But I don’t ca re about that and I can finance my own pictures. Because I \\nhate that bastard Fontane. Tell your boss this is  one favor I can’t give but that he should \\ntry me again on anything else. Anything at all.” \\nHagen thought, you sneaky bastard, then why the hell did you bring me all the way out here? The producer had something on his mind. Hagen said coldly, “I don’t think you \\nunderstand the situation. Mr. Corleone is J ohnny Fontane’s godfather. That is a very  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 48\\nclose, a very sacred religious relationship. ” Woltz bowed his head in respect at this \\nreference to religion. Hagen went  on. “Italians have a little joke, that the world is so hard \\na man must have two fathers to look after him, and that’s why they have godfathers. \\nSince Johnny’s father died, Mr. Corleone feels his responsibility even more deeply. As \\nfor trying you again, Mr. Corleone is much too sensitive. He never asks a second favor \\nwhere he has been refused the first.” \\nWoltz shrugged. “I’m sorry. The answer is still no . But since you’re here, what will it cost \\nme to have that labor trouble cl eared up? In cash. Right now.” \\nThat solved one puzzle for Hagen. Why Woltz was putting in so much time on him when \\nhe had already decided not to give Johnny t he part. And that could not be changed at \\nthis meeting. Woltz felt secure; he was not  afraid of the power of Don Corleone. And \\ncertainly Woltz with his national political connections, his acquaintanceship with the FBI \\nchief, his huge personal fortune and his absolute power in t he film industry, could not \\nfeel threatened by Don Corleone. To any intell igent man, even to H agen, it seemed that \\nWoltz had correctly assessed his position. He was impregnable to the Don if he was \\nwilling to take the losses t he labor struggle would cost. T here was only one thing wrong \\nwith the whole equation. Don Corleone had promised his godson he would get the part \\nand Don Corleone had never, to Hagen’s knowledge, broken his word in such matters. \\nHagen said quietly, “You are deliberately misunderstanding me . You are trying to make \\nme an accomplice to extortion.  Mr. Corleone promises only to speak in your favor on \\nthis labor trouble as a matter of friendship in  return for your speaking in behalf of his \\nclient. A friendly exchange of influence, nothi ng more. But I can see you don’t take me \\nseriously. Personally, I thin k that is a mistake.” \\nWoltz, as if he had been waiting for such a moment, let himself ge t angry. “I understood \\nperfectly,” he said. “That’s the Mafia style, isn’t is? All oliv e oil and sweet talk when what \\nyou’re really doing is making threats. So le t me lay it on the line. Johnny Fonfane will \\nnever get that part and he’s perfect for it. It  would make him a great star. But he never \\nwill be because I hate that pinko punk and I’m going to run him out of the movies. And \\nI’ll tell you why. He ruined one of my most  valuable protegees. For five years I had this \\ngirl under training, singing, dancing, acting lessons, I spent hundreds of thousands of \\ndollars. I was going to make her a star. I’ll be even more frank, just to show you that I’m \\nnot a hard-hearted man, that it  wasn’t all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and \\nshe was the greatest piece of ass I’ve ever had and I’ve had them all over the world. \\nShe could suck you out like a water pump. T hen Johnny comes along with that olive-oil  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 49\\nvoice and guinea charm and she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me \\nridiculous. A man in my positi on, Mr. Hagen, can’t afford to look ridiculous. I have to pay \\nJohnny off.” \\nFor the first time, Woltz succeeded in astoun ding Hagen. He found it inconceivable that \\na grown man of substance would let such trivialities affect his judgment in an affair of \\nbusiness, and one of such impor tance. In Hagen’s world, the Corleones’ world, the \\nphysical beauty, the sexu al power of women, carried not t he slightest weight in worldly \\nmatters. It was a private affair , except, of course, in ma tters of marriage and family \\ndisgrace. Hagen decided to make one last try. \\n“You are absolutely right, Mr. Woltz,” Hagen said. “But are your grievances that major? I \\ndon’t think you’ve understood how important this very small favor is to my client. Mr. \\nCorleone held the infant Johnny in his arms when he was baptized. When Johnny’s \\nfather died, Mr. Corleone assumed the duties of parenthood, indeed he is called \\n‘Godfather’ by many, many peop le who wish to show their respect and gratitude for the \\nhelp he has given them. Mr. Corleone never lets his friends down.” \\nWoltz stood up abruptly. “I’ve listened to about  enough. Thugs don’t give me orders, I \\ngive them orders. If I pick up this phone, you’ll spend the night in jail. And if that Mafia \\ngoombah tries any rough stuff, he’ll find out I’m not a band leader. Yeah, I heard that \\nstory too. Listen, your Mr. Co rleone will never know what hit him. Even if I have to use \\nmy influence at the White House.” \\nThe stupid, stupid son of a bitch. How the hell did he get to be a pezzonovante, Hagen \\nwondered. Advisor to the President, head of  the biggest movie studio in the world. \\nDefinitely the Don sh ould get into the movie business. And the guy was taking his words \\nat their sentimental face value. He was not getting the message. \\n“Thank you for the dinner and a pleasant ev ening,” Hagen said. “Could you give me \\ntransportation to the airport? I don’t think I’ll spend the night.” He smiled coldly at Woltz. \\n“Mr. Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news at once.” \\nWhile waiting in the floodlit colonnade of the mansion for his car, Hagen saw two women \\nabout to enter a long limousine already parked in the driveway. They were the beautiful \\ntwelve-year-old blond girl and her mother he had seen in Woltz’s office that morning. But \\nnow the girl’s exquisitely cut mouth seemed to have smeared into a thick, pink mass. \\nHer sea-blue eyes were filmed over and w hen she walked down the steps toward the \\nopen car her long legs tottered like a crippled foal’s. Her mother supported the child,  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 50\\nhelping her into the car, hissing commands into  her ear. The mother’s head turned for a \\nquick furtive look at Hagen and he saw in her eyes a burning, hawklike triumph. Then \\nshe too disappeared into the limousine. \\nSo that was why he hadn’t got the plane ride from Los Angeles, Hagen thought. The girl \\nand her mother had made the tr ip with the movie producer. That had given Woltz \\nenough time to relax before dinner and do the j ob on the little kid. And Johnny wanted to \\nlive in this world? Good luck to him, and good luck to Woltz. \\n* * *  \\nPaulie Gatto hated quickie jobs, especially when they involved vi olence. He liked to plan \\nthings ahead. And something like tonight, even though it wa s punk stuff, could turn into \\nserious business if somebody made a mistak e. Now, sipping his beer, he glanced \\naround, checking how the two young punks were making out with the two little tramps at \\nthe bar. \\nPaulie Gatto knew everything there was to know about those two punks. Their names were Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan. They were both about twenty years old, \\ngoodlooking, brown-haired,  tall, well-built. Both were due to go back to college out of \\ntown in two weeks, both had fathers with polit ical influence and this, with their college \\nstudent classification, had so fa r kept them out of the draft. They were both also under \\nsuspended sentences for assaulting the d aughter of Amerigo B onasera. The lousy \\nbastards, Paulie Gatto thought. Draft dodging, vi olating their probati on by drinking in a \\nbar after midnight, chasing floozies. Young punks. Paulie Gatto had been deferred from \\nthe draft himself because his doctor had furnished the draft board with documents \\nshowing that this patient, male, whit e, aged twenty-six, unmarried, had received \\nelectrical shock treatments for a mental condition. All false, of course, but Paulie Gatto \\nfelt that he had earned his draft exemption. It had been arranged by Clemenza after \\nGatto had “made his bones” in the family business. \\nIt was Clemenza who had told him that this j ob must be rushed through, before the boys \\nwent to college. Why the hell did it have to be done in New York, Gatto wondered. \\nClemenza was always giving extr a orders instead of just giving out the job. Now if those \\ntwo little tramps walked out with the punks it would be another night wasted. \\nHe could hear one of the girl s laughing and saying, “Are y ou crazy, Jerry? I’m not going \\nin any car with you. I don’t want to wind up in the hospital like  that other poor girl.” Her \\nvoice was spitefully rich with satisfaction.  That was enough for Gatto. He finished up his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 51\\nbeer and walked out into the dark street. Perf ect. It was after midnight. There was only \\none other bar that showed light. The rest of t he stores were closed. The precinct patrol \\ncar had been taken care of by Clemenza. T hey wouldn’t be around that way until they \\ngot a radio call and then they’d come slow. \\nHe leaned against the four-door Chevy sedan. In the back seat two men were sitting, \\nalmost invisible, although they were very bi g men. Paulie said, “Take them when they \\ncome out.” \\nHe still thought it had a ll been set up too fast. Clemenza had given him copies of the \\npolice mug shots of the two punks, the dope on where the punks went drinking every \\nnight to pick up bar girls. Paulie had recruit ed two of the strong-arms in the family and \\nfingered the punks for them. He had also given them their instructions. No blows on the \\ntop or the back of the head, there was to be no accidental fatality. Other than that they \\ncould go as far as they liked. He had given them only one warning: “If those punks get \\nout of the hospital in le ss than a month, you guys go back to driving trucks.” \\nThe two big men were getting out of the ca r. They were both ex-boxers who had never \\nmade it past the small clubs  and had been fixed up by Sonny Corleone with a little \\nloan-shark action so that they could make a decent living. They were, naturally, anxious \\nto show their gratitude. \\nWhen Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan came out of the bar they were perfect setups. \\nThe bar girl’s taunts had left their adolescent v anity prickly. Paulie  Gatto, leaning against \\nthe fender of his car, called out to them with a teasing laugh, “Hey, Casanova, those broads really brushed you off.” \\nThe two young men turned on him with delight. P aulie Gatto looked like a perfect outlet \\nfor their humiliation. Ferret-faced, short, slight ly built and a wise guy in the bargain. They \\npounced on him eagerly and immediately found their arms pinned by two men grabbing \\nthem from behind. At the sa me moment Paulie Gatto had slipped onto hi s right hand a \\nspecially made set of brass k nuckles studded with one-sixt eenth-inch iron spikes. His \\ntiming was good, he worked out in the gym three times a week. He smashed the punk \\nnamed Wagner right on the nose.  The man holding Wagner li fted him up off the ground \\nand Paulie swung his arm, uppercutting into the perfectly positioned groin. Wagner went \\nlimp and the big man dropped him. This had taken no more than six seconds. \\nNow both of them turned their attention to Kevin Moonan, who was trying to shout. The \\nman holding him from behind did so easily with one huge muscled arm. The other hand  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 52\\nhe put around Moonan’s throat  to cut off any sound. \\nPaulie Gatto jumped into the car and started the motor. The two big men were beating \\nMoonan to jelly. They did so with frightening delib eration, as if they had all the time in \\nthe world. They did not throw punches in fl urries but in timed, slow-motion sequences \\nthat carried the full weight of  their massive bodies. Each blow landed with a splat of \\nflesh splitting open. Gatto got a glimpse of  Moonan’s face. It was unrecognizable. The \\ntwo men left Moonan lying on the sidewalk and turned their attention to Wagner. \\nWagner was trying to get to his feet and he  started to scream fo r help. Someone came \\nout of the bar and the two men had to work faster now. They clubbed Wagner to his \\nknees. One of the men took his arm and twist ed it, then kicked him in the spine. There \\nwas a cracking sound and Wagner’s scream of agony brought window s open all along \\nthe street. The two men worked very quickly.  One of them held Wagner up by using his \\ntwo hands around Wagner’s head like a vise. The other man smashed his huge fist into \\nthe fixed target. There were more people coming out of the bar but none tried to \\ninterfere. Paulie Gatto yelled, “Come on,  enough.” The two big men jumped into the car \\nand Paulie gunned it away, Somebody would describe the car and read the license \\nplates but it didn’t matter. It was a stol en California plate and there were one hundred \\nthousand black Chevy sedans in New York City. \\nChapter 2  \\nTom Hagen went to his law offi ce in the city on Thursday morning. He planned to catch \\nup on his paper work so as to have everything cleared away for the meeting with Virgil \\nSollozzo on Friday. A meeting of such im portance that he had asked the Don for a full \\nevening of talk to prepare fo r the proposition they knew So llozzo would offer the family \\nbusiness. Hagen wanted to have all little details cleared away so that he could go to that \\npreparatory meeting wit h an unencumbered mind. \\nThe Don had not seemed surprised when Hagen returned from California late Tuesday \\nevening and told him the results of the negotiations with Woltz. He had made Hagen go \\nover every detail and grimac ed with distaste when Hagen told about the beautiful little \\ngirl and her mother. He ha d murmured “infamita,” his strongest disapproval. He had \\nasked Hagen one final question. “Does  this man have real balls?” \\nHagen considered exactly what the Don meant by this question. Over the years he had \\nlearned that the Don’s values we re so different from those of most people that his words \\nalso could have a different meaning. Did Woltz have charac ter? Did he have a strong  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 53\\nwill? He most certainly did, but that was not what the Don was asking. Did the movie \\nproducer have the courage not to be bluff ed? Did he have the willingness to suffer \\nheavy financial loss delay on his movies would mean, the scandal of his big star \\nexposed as a user of heroin? Again the answ er was yes. But again this was not what \\nthe Don meant. Finally Hagen translated the question properly in his mind. Did Jack Woltz have the balls to risk everything, to r un the chance of losing all on a matter of \\nprinciple, on a matte r of honor; for revenge? \\nHagen smiled. He di d it rarely but now he could not resist jesting with the Don. “You’re \\nasking if he is a Sicilian.” The Don nod ded his head pleasantly, acknowledging the \\nflattering witticism and its truth. “No,” Hagen said. \\nThat had been all. T he Don had pondered t he question until the next day. On \\nWednesday afternoon he had called Hagen to hi s home and given him his instructions. \\nThe instructions had consumed the rest of Hagen’s working day and left him dazed with \\nadmiration. There was no question in his mind  that the Don had solved the problem, that \\nWoltz would call him this morning with the news that Johnny Fontane had the starring \\npart in his new war movie. \\nAt that moment the phone did ring but it was Amerigo Bonasera. The undertaker’s voice was trembling with gratitude.  He wanted Hagen to convey to the Don his undying \\nfriendship. The Don had only to call on him. He, Amerigo Bonasera, would lay down his \\nlife for the blessed Godfat her. Hagen assured him that  the Don would be told. \\nThe Daily News had carried a middle-page spread of Jerry  Wagner and Kevin Moonan \\nlying in the street. The photos  were expertly gruesome, t hey seemed to be pulps of \\nhuman beings. Miraculously, said the News, t hey were both still al ive though they would \\nboth be in the hospital for months and would require plastic surgery. Hagen made a note \\nto tell Clemenza that something should be done for Paulie Gatto. He seemed to know \\nhis job. \\nHagen worked quickly and efficiently for the next three hours consolidating earning \\nreports from the Don’s real estate com pany, his olive oil importing business and his \\nconstruction firm. None of them  were doing well but with th e war over they should all \\nbecome rich producers. He had almost for gotten the Johnny Font ane problem when his \\nsecretary told him California was calling. He felt a little thrill of anticipation as he picked \\nup the phone and said, “Hagen here.” \\nThe voice that came over the phone was unrecognizable wit h hate and passion. “You  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 54\\nfucking bastard,” Woltz screamed. “I’ll have you all in jail for a hundred years. I’ll spend \\nevery penny I have to get you. I’ll get that Johnny Fontane’s balls cut off, do you hear \\nme, you guinea fuck?” \\nHagen said kindly, “I’m German-Irish.” Ther e was a long pause and then a click of the \\nphone being hung up. Hagen smiled. Not once had Woltz uttered a threat against Don \\nCorleone himself. Genius had its rewards. \\n* * *  \\nJack Woltz always slept alone. He had a bed big enough for ten people and a bedroom \\nlarge enough for a movie ball room scene, but he had slept alone since the death of his \\nfirst wife ten years before. This did not mean he no longer us ed women. He was \\nphysically a vigorous man despi te his age, but he could be aroused now only by very \\nyoung girls and had learned that a few hours in the evening  were all the youth his body \\nand his patience could tolerate. \\nOn this Thursday morning, for some reason,  he awoke early. The light of dawn made his \\nhuge bedroom as misty as a foggy meadowland. Far down at the fo ot of his bed was a \\nfamiliar shape and Woltz struggled up on his el bows to get a clearer look. It had the \\nshape of a horse’s head. Still groggy, Woltz reached and flicked on the night table lamp. \\nThe shock of what he saw made him ph ysically ill. It seemed as if a great \\nsledgehammer had struck him on the chest, his heartbeat jumped erratically and he became nauseous. His vomit spluttered on the thick bear rug. \\nSevered from its body, the bl ack silky head of the great hor se Khartoum was stuck fast \\nin a thick cake of blood. White, reedy tendons showed. Froth covered the muzzle and \\nthose apple-sized eyes that ha d glinted like gold, were mottled the color of rotting fruit \\nwith dead, hemorrhaged blood. Wo ltz was struck by a purely animal terror and out of \\nthat terror he screamed for his servants and out of that te rror he called Hagen to make \\nhis uncontrolled threats. His maniacal ravi ng alarmed the butler, who called Woltz’s \\npersonal physician and his second in comm and at the studio. Bu t Woltz regained his \\nsenses before they arrived. \\nHe had been profoundly shocke d. What kind of man could destroy an animal worth six \\nhundred thousand dollars? Without a word of wa rning. Without any negotiation to have \\nthe act, its order, countermanded. The ruthlessness, the sheer disregard for any values, \\nimplied a man who considered himself completely his own law, even his own God. And \\na man who backed up this kind  of will with the power and cunning that held his own  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 55\\nstable security force of no account. For by this time Woltz had learned that the horse’s \\nbody had obviously been heavily drugged bef ore someone leisurely hacked the huge \\ntriangular head off with an ax . The men on night duty cl aimed that they had heard \\nnothing. To Woltz this seemed impossible. T hey could be made to talk. They had been \\nbought off and they could be made to  tell who had done the buying. \\nWoltz was not a stupid man, be was merely  a supremely egotistical one. He had \\nmistaken the power he wielded in his world to  be more potent than the power of Don \\nCorleone. He had merely needed so me proof that this was not  true. He understood this \\nmessage. That despite all his wealth, despite all his contacts with the President of the \\nUnited States, despite all his cl aims of friendship with the di rector of the FBI, an obscure \\nimporter of Italian olive oil would have hi m killed. Would actually have him killed! \\nBecause he wouldn’t give Johnny Fontane a movie part he wanted. It was incredible. \\nPeople didn’t have any right to  act that way. There couldn ’t be any kind of world if \\npeople acted that way. It wa s insane. It meant you couldn ’t do what you wanted with \\nyour own money, with the companies you owned,  the power you had to give orders. It \\nwas ten times worse than communism. It had to  be smashed. It must never be allowed. \\nWoltz let the doctor give him a very mild s edation. It helped him calm down again and to \\nthink sensibly. What really shocked hi m was the casualness with which this man \\nCorleone had ordered the destruction of a wo rld-famous horse worth six hundred \\nthousand dollars. Six hundred thous and dollars! And that wa s just for openers. Woltz \\nshuddered. He thought of this li fe he had built up. He was rich. He could have the most \\nbeautiful women in the world by cooking his finger and pr omising a contract. He was \\nreceived by kings and queens. He lived a life as perfect as money and power could \\nmake it. It was crazy to risk all this because of a whim. Maybe he could get to Corleone. \\nWhat was the legal penalty for killing a ra cehorse? He laughed wildly and his doctor and \\nservants watched him with nervous anxiety. Another thought occurred to him. He would \\nbe the laughingstock of California merely because someone had contemptuously defied \\nhis power in such arrogant fashion. That decided him. That and the thought that maybe, \\nmaybe they wouldn’t kill him. That they had something much more clever and painful in \\nreserve. \\nWoltz gave the necessary orders. His personal confidential staff sw ung into action. The \\nservants and the doctor were sworn to secr ecy on pain of incurring the studio’s and \\nWoltz’s undying enmity. Word was given to the press that the racehorse Khartoum had \\ndied of an illness contracted during his shipm ent from England. Orders were given to  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 56\\nbury the remains in a secret place on the estate. \\nSix hours later Johnny Fontane received a phone ca ll from the executiv e producer of the \\nfilm telling him to report for work the following Monday. \\n* * *  \\nThat evening, Hagen went to the Don’s house  to prepare him for the important meeting \\nthe next day with Virgil Sollozzo. The Don had summoned his eldest son to attend, and \\nSonny Corleone, his heavy Cupid-shaped face drawn with fatigue, was sipping at a \\nglass of water. He must still be humping that maid of honor, Hagen thought. Another \\nworry. \\nDon Corleone settled into an armchair puffi ng his Di Nobili cigar. Hagen kept a box of \\nthem in his room. He had tried to get the Don to switch to Havanas but the Don claimed \\nthey hurt his throat. \\n“Do we know everything necessary fo r us to know?” the Don asked. \\nHagen opened the folder that held his notes. The notes were  in no way incriminating, \\nmerely cryptic reminders to make sure he t ouched on every important detail. “Sollozzo is \\ncoming to us for help,” Hagen said. “He will ask the family to put up at least a million \\ndollars and to promise some sort of immunity from the law. For t hat we get a piece of \\nthe action, nobody knows how much. Sollozzo is  vouched for by the Tattaglia family and \\nthey may have a piece of the action. The ac tion is narcotics. Sollozzo has the contacts \\nin Turkey, where they grow the poppy. From ther e he ships to Sicily. No trouble. In Sicily \\nhe has the plant to process into heroin. He ha s safety-valve operations to bring it down \\nto morphine and bring it up to heroin if necessary. But it would seem  that the processing \\nplant in Sicily is protected in every way. The only hitch is bringing it into this country, and \\nthen distribution. Also initial capital. A million dollars cash doesn’t grow on trees.” Hagen \\nsaw Don Corleone grimace.T he old man hated unnecessary flourishes in business \\nmatters. He went on hastily. \\n“They call Sollozzo the Turk. Two reasons. He’s  spent a lot of time in Turkey and is \\nsupposed to have a Turkish wife and kids. Second. He’s supposed to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was young. Only in matters  of business, though, and with \\nsome sort of reasonable complaint. A very competent man and his own boss. He has a \\nrecord, he’s done two terms in prison, one in  Italy, one in the Un ited States, and he’s \\nknown to the authorities as a narcotics man. This could be a plus for us. It means that \\nhe’ll never get immunity to testify, since he’ s considered the top an d, of course, because  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 57\\nof his record. Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family \\nman. He’ll stand still for any rap as long as he knows that they  will be well taken care of \\nfor living money.” \\nThe Don puffed on his cigar and said, “Santino, what do you think?” \\nHagen knew what Sonny would say. Sonny  was chafing at being under the Don’s \\nthumb. He wanted a bi g operation of his own. Something like this would be perfect. \\nSonny took a long slug of scotch. “There’s a lo t of money it that wh ite powder,” he said. \\n“But it could be dangerous. So me people could wind up in jail for twenty years. I’d say \\nthat if we kept out of the operations end, just stuck to pr otection and financing, it might \\nbe a good idea.” \\nHagen looked at Sonny approvingly.  He had played his cards well. He had stuck to the \\nobvious, much the best course for him. \\nThe Don puffed on his cigar. “And you, Tom, what do you think?” \\nHagen composed himself to be absolutely honest. He had already come to the \\nconclusion that the Don would refuse So llozzo’s proposition. But what was worse, \\nHagen was convinced that for one of the few times in his experien ce, the Don had not \\nthought things through. He was not looking far enough ahead. \\n“Go ahead, Tom,” the Don said encouragingly. “Not even a Sicilian Consigliere always \\nagrees with the boss.” They all laughed. \\n“I think you should say yes,” Hagen said. “You know all the obvious reasons. But the most important one is this. Ther e is more money potential in narcotics than in any other \\nbusiness. If we don’t get into it, somebody else  will, maybe the Tattaglia family. With the \\nrevenue they earn they can amass more and more police and political power. Their \\nfamily will become stronger  than ours. Eventually they will come after us to take away \\nwhat we have. It’s just like countries. If they arm, we have to  arm. If they become \\nstronger economically, they become a threat to us. Now we have the gambling and we \\nhave the unions and right now th ey are the best things to have. But I think narcotics is \\nthe coming thing. I think we have to have a pi ece of that action or we risk everything we \\nhave. Not now, but maybe ten years from now.” \\nThe Don seemed enormously impressed. He puffed on his cigar and murmured, “That’s \\nthe most important thing of c ourse.” He sighed and got to hi s feet. “What time do I have \\nto meet this infidel tomorrow?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 58\\nHagen said hopefully, “He’ll be here at ten in the morning. ” Maybe the Don would go for \\nit. \\n“I’ll want you both here with me,” the Don said. He rose, stretching, and took his son by \\nthe arm. “Santino, get some sleep tonight, y ou look like the devil himself. Take care of \\nyourself, you won’t be young forever.” \\nSonny, encouraged by this sign of fatherly concern, asked the question Hagen did not \\ndare to ask. “Pop, what’s your answer going to be?” \\nDon Corleone smiled. “How do I know until  I hear the percentages and other details? \\nBesides I have to have time to think over the advice given here tonight. After all, I’m not \\na man who does things rashly.” As he went out the door he said casually to Hagen, “Do \\nyou have in your notes that the Turk made his living from prostitution before the war? As \\nthe Tattaglia family does now. Write that down before you forget.” There was just a \\ntouch of derision in the Don’s voice and Hagen flushed. He had deliberately not \\nmentioned it, legitimately so since it really had no beari ng, but he had feared it might \\nprejudice the Don’s decision. He was notor iously straitlaced in matters of sex. \\n* * *  \\nVirgil “the Turk” Sollozzo was a powerfully  built, medium-sized ma n of dark complexion \\nwho could have been taken for a true Turk. He had a scimitar of a nose and cruel black eyes. He also had an impressive dignity. \\nSonny Corleone met him at the door and brought him into the office where Hagen and \\nthe Don waited. Hagen thought he had nev er seen a more dangerous-looking man \\nexcept for Luca Brasi. \\nThere were polite handshakings all around. If  the Don ever asks me if this man has \\nballs, I would have to answer yes, Hagen t hought. He had never seen such force in one \\nman, not even the Don. In fact the Don appeared at his worst. He was being a little too simple, a little too peasant like in his greeting. \\nSollozzo came to the point immediately. T he business was narcotic. Everything was set \\nup. Certain poppy fields in Turkey had pled ged him certain amounts every year. He had \\na protected plant in France to convert into morphine. He had an absolutely secure plant \\nin Sicily to process into heroin. Smuggling in to both countries was as positively safe as \\nsuch matters could be. Entry into the Unit ed States would entail about five percent \\nlosses since the FBI itself was incorruptible, as they both knew. But the profits would be enormous, the risk nonexistent.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 59\\n“Then why do you come to me?” the Don ask ed politely. “How have I deserved your \\ngenerosity?” \\nSollozzo’s dark face remained impassive. “I need two million dollars cash,” he said. \\n“Equally important, I need a man who has power ful friends in the important places. \\nSome of my couriers will be caught over the y ears. That is inevitable. They will all have \\nclean records, that I promise.  So it will be logical for judges to give light sentences. I \\nneed a friend who can guarantee that when my people get in trouble they won’t spend \\nmore than a year or two in jail. Then they won’ t talk. But if they get ten and twenty years, \\nwho knows? In this world there are many weak individuals. They may talk, they may \\njeopardize more important people. Legal protecti on is a must. I hear, Don Corleone, that \\nyou have as many judges in your pocket as a bootblack has pieces of silver.” \\nDon Corleone didn’t bother to  acknowledge the complimen t. “What percentage for my \\nfamily?” he asked. \\nSollozzo’s eyes gleamed. “F ifty percent.” He paused and t hen said in a voice that was \\nalmost a caress, “In the first year your shar e would be three or four million dollars. Then \\nit would go up.” \\nDon Corleone said, “And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?” \\nFor the first time Sollozzo seemed to be ner vous. “They will receive something from my \\nshare. I need some help in the operations.” \\n“So,” Don Corleone said, “I receive fifty perc ent merely for finance and legal protection. I \\nhave no worries about operations, is  that what you tell me?” \\nSollozzo nodded. “If you think two million dollars in cash is ‘merely finance,’ I \\ncongratulate you, Don Corleone.” \\nThe Don said quietly, “I consented to see y ou out of my respect for the Tattaglias and \\nbecause I’ve heard you are a serious man to be treated also with respect. I must say no \\nto you but I must give you my  reasons. The profits in your business are huge but so are \\nthe risks. Your operation, if I were part of it, could damage my other interests. It’s true I \\nhave many, many friends in politics, but th ey would not be so friendly if my business \\nwere narcotics instead of gambling. They think gambling is something like liquor, a \\nharmless vice, and they think narcotics a dirt y business. No, don’t protest. I’m telling you \\ntheir thoughts, not mine. How a man makes his living is not my concern. And what I am \\ntelling you is that this business of yours is too risky. All the member s of my family have \\nlived well the last t en years, without danger, without harm. I can’t endanger them or their  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 60\\nlivelihoods out of greed.” \\nThe only sign of Sollozzo’s di sappointment was a quick fli ckering of his eyes around the \\nroom, as if he hoped Hagen or Sonny would speak in his support. Then he said, “Are \\nyou worried about security for your two million?” \\nThe Don smiled coldly. “No,” he said. \\nSollozzo tried again. “The Tattaglia family  will guarantee your investment also.” \\nIt was then that Sonny Corleone made an unfor givable error in judgment and procedure. \\nHe said eagerly, “The Tattaglia family guar antees the return of our investment without \\nany percentage from us?” \\nHagen was horrified at this break . He saw the Don turn cold, malevolent eyes on his \\neldest son, who froze in uncomprehending dism ay. Sollozzo’s eyes flickered again but \\nthis time with satisfaction. He had discove red a chink in the Don’s fortress. When the \\nDon spoke his voice held a dismissal. “Y oung people are greedy,” he said. “And today \\nthey have no manners. They interrupt their elders. They meddle. But I have a \\nsentimental weakness for my children and I have spoiled them. As you see. Signor \\nSollozzo, my no is final. Let me say that I myself wish you good fortune in your business. It has no conflict with my own. I’m sorry that I had to disappoint you.” \\nSollozzo bowed, shook the Don’s hand and let Hagen take him to his car outside. There \\nwas no expression on his face when he said good-bye to Hagen. \\nBack in the room, Don Corleone asked Hagen,  “What did you thin k of that man?” \\n“He’s a Sicilian,” Hagen said dryly. \\nThe Don nodded his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to his son and said gently, “Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking. Never let \\nthem know what you have under your fingernails. I think your brain is going soft from all \\nthat comedy you play with that  young girl. Stop it and pay a ttention to busin ess. Now get \\nout of my sight.” \\nHagen saw the surprise on Sonny’s face, t hen anger at his father’s reproach. Did he \\nreally think the Don would be ignorant of his conquest, Hagen wondered. And did he \\nreally not know what a danger ous mistake he had made this mo rning? If that were true, \\nHagen would never wish to be the Consiglie re to the Don of Santino Corleone. \\nDon Corleone waited until Sonny had left the room. Then he sank back into his leather \\narmchair and motioned brusquely for a drink. Hagen poured him a glass of anisette. The  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 61\\nDon looked up at him. “Send Luc a Brasi to see me,” he said. \\n* * *  \\nThree months later, Hagen hurri ed through the paper work in his city office hoping to \\nleave early enough for some Christmas shopping for his wife and children. He was \\ninterrupted by a phone call from a Johnny Fo ntane bubbling with high sp irits. The picture \\nhad been shot, the rushes, whatever the hell they were, Hagen thought, were fabulous. \\nHe was sending the Don a present for Christ mas that would knock his eyes out, he’d \\nbring it himself but there were some little th ings to be done in the movie. He would have \\nto stay out on the Coast. Hagen tried to conceal his impatience. Johnny Fontane’s \\ncharm had always been lost on him. But his interest was aroused. “What is it?” he \\nasked. Johnny Fontane chuckled and said, “I can’t tell, that’s the best part of a \\nChristmas present.” Hagen immedi ately lost all interest and finally managed, politely, to \\nhang up. \\nTen minutes later his secretary told him that Connie Corleone was on the phone and \\nwanted to speak to him. Hagen  sighed. As a young girl Connie had been nice, as a \\nmarried woman she was a nuisance. She m ade complaints about her husband. She \\nkept going home to visit her mother for two or three days. And Carlo Rizzi was turning \\nout to be a real loser. He ha d been fixed up with a nice little business and was running it \\ninto the ground. He was also drinking, w horing around, gambling and beating his wife up \\noccasionally. Connie hadn’t told her family  about that but she had told Hagen. He \\nwondered what new tale of woe she had for him now. \\nBut the Christmas spirit seemed to have c heered her up. She just wanted to ask Hagen \\nwhat her father would rea lly like for Christmas. And Sonny and Fred and Mike. She \\nalready knew what she woul d get her mother. Hagen made some suggestions, all of \\nwhich she rejected as silly. Finally she let him go. \\nWhen the phone rang again, Hagen threw his papers back into the basket. The hell with \\nit. He’d leave. It never occurr ed to him to refuse to take the call, however. When his \\nsecretary told him it was Michael Corieon e he picked up the phone with pleasure. He \\nhad always liked Mike. \\n“Tom,” Michael Corleone said, “I’m driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow. There’s \\nsomething important I want to tell the old man before Christmas. Will he be home \\ntomorrow night?” \\n“Sure,” Hagen said. “He’s not goi ng out of town until after Christmas. Anything I can do  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 62\\nfor you?” \\nMichael was as closemouthed as his father . “No,” he said. “I guess I’ll see you \\nChristmas, everybody is going to  be out at Long Beach, right?” \\n“Right,” Hagen said. He was amused when Mi ke hung up on him without any small talk. \\nHe told his secretary to ca ll his wife and tell her he would be home a li ttle late but to \\nhave some supper for him. Outside the build ing he walked briskly downtown toward \\nMacy’s. Someone stepped in his way. To his surprise he saw it was Sollozzo. \\nSollozzo took him by the arm and said quietly,  “Don’t be frightened. I just want to talk to \\nyou.” A car parked at the curb  suddenly had its door open. Soll ozzo said urgently, “Get \\nin, I want to talk to you.”. \\nHagen pulled his arm loose. He was still not ala rmed, just irritated. “I haven’t got time,” \\nhe said. At that moment two men came up behind him. Hagen felt a sudden weakness \\nin his legs. Sollozzo said softl y, “Get in the car. If I wanted to kill you y ou’d be dead now. \\nTrust me.” \\nWithout a shred of trust Hagen got into the car. \\n* * *  \\nMichael Corleone had li ed to Hagen. He was already in New York, and he had called \\nfrom a room in the Hotel Pennsylvania le ss than ten blocks away. When he hung up the \\nphone, Kay Adams put out her cigarette and said, “Mike, what a good fibber you are.” \\nMichael sat down beside her on the bed. “All for y ou, honey; if I told my family we were \\nin town we’d have to go there right away. Then we couldn’t go out to dinner, we couldn’t \\ngo to the theater, and we couldn’t sleep together  tonight. Not in my father’s house, not \\nwhen we’re not married.” He put his arms around her and ki ssed her gently on the lips. \\nHer mouth was sweet and he ge ntly pulled her down on the bed. She closed her eyes, \\nwaiting for him to make love  to her and Michael felt an enormous happiness. He had \\nspent the war years fighting in the Pacific,  and on those bloody islands he had dreamed \\nof a girl like Kay Adams. Of a beauty like her s. A fair and fragile body, milky-skinned and \\nelectrified by passion. She opened her eyes and then pulled his head down to kiss him. \\nThey made love until it was time for dinner and the theater. \\nAfter dinner they walked past the brightly lit  department stores full of holiday shoppers \\nand Michael said to her, “What s hall I get you for Christmas?” \\nShe pressed against him. “Just you,” she said . “Do you think your father will approve of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 63\\nme?” \\nMichael said gently, “That’s not really the question. Will your par ents approve of me?” \\nKay shrugged. “I don’t care,” she said. \\nMichael said, “I even thought of changing my name, legally, but if something happened, \\nthat wouldn’t really help. You sure you want to be a Corleone?” He said it only \\nhalf-jokingly. \\n“Yes,” she said without smiling. They pre ssed against each other. They had decided to \\nget married during Christmas week, a quiet ci vil ceremony at City Hall with just two \\nfriends as witnesses. But Michael had insisted he must tell his father. He had explained \\nthat his father would not object in any way as long as it was not  done in secrecy. Kay \\nwas doubtful. She said she could not tell he r parents until after the marriage. “Of course \\nthey’ll think I’m pregnant,” she said. Michael  grinned. “So will my parents,” he said. \\nWhat neither of them  mentioned was the fact  that Michael would have to cut his close \\nties with his family. They both understood that Michael had already done so to some \\nextent and yet they both felt guilty about this fact. They pl anned to finish college, seeing \\neach other weekends and livin g together during summer vacations. It seemed like a \\nhappy life. \\nThe play was a musical called Carousel and its sentimental story of a braggart thief \\nmade them smile at each other with amusement. When they came out of the theater it \\nhad turned cold. Kay snuggled up to him and said, “After we’re married, will you beat me \\nand then steal a star for a present?” \\nMichael laughed. “I’m going to be a mathematics professor,” he said. Then he asked, \\n“Do you want something to eat before we go to the hotel?” \\nKay shook her head. She looked  up at him meaningfully. As always he was touched by \\nher eagerness to make love. He smiled down at her, and they kissed in the cold street. \\nMichael felt hungry, and he decided to order sandwiches sent  up to the room. \\nIn the hotel lobby Michael pushed Kay towa rd the newsstand and sa id, “Get the papers \\nwhile I get the key.” He had to wait in a small line; the hotel was still short of help despite \\nthe end of the war. Michael got his room key and looked around impatiently for Kay. She \\nwas standing by the newsstand, staring down at a newspaper she held in her hand. He \\nwalked toward her. She looked up at him. Her eyes were filled with tears. “Oh, Mike,” \\nshe said, “oh, Mike.” He took the paper fr om her hands. The first thing he saw was a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 64\\nphoto of his father lying in the street, his head in a pool of blood. A man was sitting on \\nthe curb weeping like a child. It was his brother  Freddie. Michael Corleone felt his body \\nturning to ice. There was no grief, no fear, just  cold rage. He said to Kay, “Go up to the \\nroom.” But he had to take her by the arm and lead her into the elevator. They rode up \\ntogether in silence. In thei r room, Michael sat down on t he bed and opened  the paper. \\nThe headlines said, VITO CORLEONE SHOT. ALLEGED RACKET CHIEF CRITICALLY \\nWOUNDED. OPERATED ON UNDER HEAVY POLICE GUARD. BLOODY MOB WAR \\nFEARED. \\nMichael felt the weakness in his legs. He said  to Kay, “He’s not dead, the bastards didn’t \\nkill him.” He read the story again. His father had been shot at five in the afternoon. That \\nmeant that while he had been ma king love to Kay, having di nner, enjoying the theater, \\nhis father was near death. Michael felt sick with guilt. \\nKay said, “Shall we go down to the hospital now?” \\nMichael shook his head. “Let me call the house first. The people who did this are crazy \\nand now that the old man’s still alive they ’ll be desperate. Who the hell knows what \\nthey’ll pull next.” \\nBoth phones in the Long Beach house were bu sy and it was almost twenty minutes \\nbefore Michael could get through. He  heard Sonny’s voice saying, “Yeah.” \\n“Sonny, it’s me,” Michael said. \\nHe could hear the relief in Sonny’s voice.  “Jesus, kid, you had us worried. Where the \\nhell are you? I’ve sent people to that hi ck town of yours to see what happened.” \\n“How’s the old man?” Michael said. “How bad is he hurt?” \\n“Pretty bad,” Sonny said. “They shot him fi ve times. But he’s tough.” Sonny’s voice was \\nproud. “The doctors said he’ll pull through. Listen, kid, I’m busy, I can’t talk, where are \\nyou?” \\n“In New York,” Michael said. “Didn’ t Tom tell you I was coming down?” \\nSonny’s voice dropped a little. “They’ve snat ched Tom. That’s why I was worried about \\nyou. His wife is here. She don ’t know and neither do the cops. I don’t want them to \\nknow. The bastards who pulled this must be crazy. I want you to get out here right away and keep your mouth shut. OK?” \\n“OK,” Mike said, “do y ou know who did it?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 65\\n“Sure,” Sonny said. “And as soon as Luca Brasi checks in they’re gonna be dead meat. \\nWe still have all the horses.” \\n“I’ll be out in a hour,” Mike said. “In a cab.” He hung up. The papers had been on the \\nstreets for over three hours.  There must have been radio news reports. It was almost \\nimpossible that Luca hadn’t heard the news. Thoughtfully Michael pondered the \\nquestion. Where was Luca Brasi? It was the same question that Hagen was asking \\nhimself at that moment. It was the same que stion that was worrying Sonny Corleone out \\nin Long Beach. \\n* * *  \\nAt a quarter to five that afternoon, Don Corleone had finished checking the papers the \\noffice manager of his olive oil company had prepared for him. He put on his jacket and \\nrapped his knuckles on his son Freddie’s head to  make him take his nose out of the \\nafternoon newspaper. “Tell Gatto to get the ca r from the lot,” he said. “I’ll be ready to go \\nhome in a few minutes.” \\nFreddie grunted. “I’ll have to get it  myself. Paulie called in sick this morning. Got a cold \\nagain.” \\nDon Corleone looked thoughtful for a moment. “T hat’s the third time this month. I think \\nmaybe you’d better get a healthier fellow for this job. Tell Tom.” \\nFred protested. “Paulie’s a good kid. If he says he’s sick, he’s sick. I don’t mind getting \\nthe car.” He left the office. Don Corleone watched out the window as his son crossed \\nNinth Avenue to the parking lot. He stopped to call Hagen’s office but there was no \\nanswer. He called the house at Long Beach but again there was no answer. Irritated, he \\nlooked out the window. His car was parked at the curb in fr ont of his building. Freddie \\nwas leaning against the fender , arms folded, watching the throng of Christmas \\nshoppers. Don Corleone put on his jacket. The office manager helped him with his \\novercoat. Don Corleone grunted his thanks and went out the door and started down the \\ntwo flights of steps. \\nOut in the street the early winter light was failing. Freddi e leaned casually against the \\nfender of the heavy Buick. When he saw his father come out of the building Freddie \\nwent out into the street to  the driver’s side of the car and got in. Don Corleone was \\nabout to get in on the sidewalk  side of the car when he hes itated and then turned back \\nto the long open fruit stand near the corner. This had been his habit lately, he loved the \\nbig out-of-season fruits, yellow peaches and oranges, that glowed in their green boxes.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 66\\nThe proprietor sprang to serve him. Don Co rleone did not handle the fruit. He pointed. \\nThe fruit man disputed his decisions only once , to show him that one  of his choices had \\na rotten underside. Don Corleone took t he paper bag in his left hand and paid the man \\nwith a five-dollar bill. He took his change and,  as he turned to go back to the waiting car, \\ntwo men stepped from around the corner. Don Co rleone knew immediately what was to \\nhappen. \\nThe two men wore black overcoats and black hat s pulled low to prevent identification by \\nwitnesses. They had not expec ted Don Corleone’s alert reaction. He dropped the bag of \\nfruit and darted toward the parked car with star tling quickness for a man of his bulk. At \\nthe same time he shouted, “Fredo, Fredo.” It  was only then that th e two men drew their \\nguns and fired. \\nThe first bullet caught Don Corleone in the ba ck. He felt the hammer shock of its impact \\nbut made his body move toward the car. The next two bullets hit him in the buttocks and \\nsent him sprawling in the middl e of the street. Meanwhile the two gunmen, careful not to \\nslip on the rolling fruit, started to follow in order to fini sh him off. At that moment, \\nperhaps no more than five seconds after t he Don’s call to his so n, Frederico Corleone \\nappeared out of his car, looming over it. The gunmen fired two more hasty shots at the \\nDon lying in the gutter. One hit him in the fleshy part of his arm and the second hit him in \\nthe calf of his right leg. T hough these wounds were the least serious they bled profusely, \\nforming small pools of blood beside his body. But by this time Don Corleone had lost consciousness. \\nFreddie had heard his father shout, calling him by his childhood name, and then he had \\nheard the first two loud reports. By the time he got out of the car he was in shock, he \\nhad not even drawn his gun. The two assassins  could easily have shot him down. But \\nthey too panicked. They must have known t he son was armed, and besides too much \\ntime had passed. They disappeared around the corner, leaving Freddie alone in the \\nstreet with his father’s bleeding body. Many of the people thronging the avenue had \\nflung themselves into doorways or on the gr ound, others had huddled together in small \\ngroups. \\nFreddie still had not drawn hi s weapon. He seemed stunned. He stared down at his \\nfather’s body lying face down on the tarred street, lying now in what seemed to him a \\nblackish lake of blood. Freddie went into physical shock. People eddied out again and \\nsomeone, seeing him start to sag, led him to the curbstone and made him sit down on it. \\nA crowd gathered around Don Co rleone’s body, a circle that shattered when the first  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 67\\npolice car sirened a path through them. Directly behind the po lice was the Daily News \\nradio car and even before it stopped a photogr apher jumped out to snap pictures of the \\nbleeding Don Corleone.  A few moments later an ambulance arrived. The photographer \\nturned his attention to Freddie Corleone, w ho was now weeping openly, and this was a \\ncuriously comical sight, because of his toug h, Cupid-featured face, heavy nose and thick \\nmouth smeared with snot. Detectives were  spreading through the crowd and more \\npolice cars were coming up. One detective knelt beside Freddie, questioning him, but \\nFreddie was too deep in shock to answer. The detective reached inside Freddie’s coat \\nand lifted his wallet. He looked at the identific ation inside and whistled to his partner. In \\njust a few seconds Freddie had been cut off from the crowd by a flock of \\nplainclothesmen. The first detective found Fr eddie’s gun in its shoulder holster and took \\nit. Then they lifted Freddie off his feet and s hoved him into an unmarked car. As that car \\npulled away it was followed by the Daily News radio car. The photographer was still \\nsnapping pictures of ev erybody and everything. \\n* * * \\nIn the half hour after the shooting of his father, Sonny Corleone received five phone \\ncalls in rapid succession. The first was from  Detective John Philli ps, who was on the \\nfamily payroll and had been in the lead car of plainclothesmen at the scene of the shooting. The first thing he said to Sonny over the phone was, “Do you recognize my \\nvoice?” \\n“Yeah,” Sonny said. He was fresh from a nap, called to the phone by his wife. \\nPhillips said quickl y without preamble, “Somebody shot your father outside his place. \\nFifteen minutes ago. He’s alive but hurt bad. They’ve taken him to French Hospital. \\nThey got your brother Freddie down at the Chelsea precinct. You better get him a doctor \\nwhen they turn him loose. I’m going down to  the hospital now to help question your old \\nman, if he can talk. I’ll keep you posted.” \\nAcross the table, Sonny’s wife Sandra noticed that her husband ’s face had gone red \\nwith flushing blood. His eyes were glazed over. She whispered, “What’s the matter?” He waved at her impatiently to shut up, swung his body away so that his back was toward \\nher and said into the phone, “You sure he’s alive?” \\n“Yeah, I’m sure,” the detective said. “A lot of blood but I think maybe he’s not as bad as \\nhe looks.” \\n“Thanks,” Sonny said. “Be home tomorrow morning eight sharp.  You got a grand  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 68\\ncoming.” \\nSonny cradled the phone. He forced himself to  sit still. He knew that his greatest \\nweakness was his anger and this was one time  when anger could be fatal. The first \\nthing to do was get Tom Hagen. But before he could pick up the phone, it rang. The call \\nwas from the bookmaker licensed by the Family to operate in the di strict of the Don’s \\noffice. The bookmaker had called to tell him that the Don had been killed, shot dead in \\nthe street. After a few questions to make sure that the bookmaker’s informant had not been close to the body, Sonny dismissed the information as incorrect. Phillips’ dope \\nwould be more accurate. The phone rang almost immediately a third time. It was a reporter from the Daily News. As soon as he identified himself, S onny Corleone hung \\nup. \\nHe dialed Hagen’s house and  asked Hagen’s wife, “Did Tom come home yet?” She \\nsaid, “No,” that he was not due for another twenty minutes but she expected him home \\nfor supper. “Have him call me,” Sonny said. \\nHe tried to think things out. He tried to imagine how his father would react in a like \\nsituation. He had known immedi ately that this was an attack by Sollozzo, but Sollozzo \\nwould never have dared to eliminate so high -ranking a leader as the Don unless he was \\nbacked by other powerful people. The phone, ringing for the f ourth time, interrupted his \\nthoughts. The voice on the other end was very soft, very gentle. “Santino Corleone?” it \\nasked. \\n“Yeah,” Sonny said. \\n“We have Tom Hagen,” the voice said. “I n about three hours he’ll be released with our \\nproposition. Don’t do anything ra sh until you’ve h eard what he has to  say. You can only \\ncause a lot of trouble. What’s done is done. Everybody has to be sensible now. Don’t \\nlose that famous temper of yours.” The vo ice was slightly mocking. Sonny couldn’t be \\nsure, but it sounded like Sollozzo. He made  his voice sound muted, depressed. “I’ll \\nwait,” he said. He heard the receiver on th e other end click. He looked at his heavy \\ngold-banded wristwatch and noted  the exact time of the call and jotted it down on the \\ntablecloth. \\nHe sat at the kitchen table, frowning. His wife asked, “Sonny, what is it?” He told her \\ncalmly, “They shot the old man.” When he sa w the shock on her face he said roughly, \\n“Don’t worry; he’s not dead. And nothing else  is going to happen.” He did not tell her \\nabout Hagen. And then the phone rang for the fifth time.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 69\\nIt was Clemenza. The fat man’s voice came wheezing over the phone in gruntlike \\ngasps. “You hear about your father?” he asked. \\n“Yeah.” Sonny said. “But he’s not dead.” T here was a long pause over the phone and \\nthen Clemenza’s voice came packed with em otion, “Thank God, thank God.” Then \\nanxiously, “You sure? I got word he was dead in the street.” \\n“He’s alive,” Sonny said. He was listening intently  to every intonation in Clemenza’s \\nvoice. The emotion had seem ed genuine but it was part of t he fat man’s profession to be \\na good actor. \\n“You’ll have to carry the ball, Sonny,” Cle menza said “What do you want me to do?” \\n“Get over to my father’s house,” Sonny said. “Bring Paulie Gatto.” \\n“That’s all?” Clemenza asked. “Don’t you want  me to send some people to the hospital \\nand your place?” \\n“No, I just want you and Paulie Gatto,” Sonny said. Ther e was a long pause. Clemenza \\nwas getting the message. To make it a littl e more natural, Sonny asked, “Where the hell \\nwas Paulie anyway? What  the hell was he doing?” \\nThere was no longer any wheez ing on the other end of the line. Clemenza’s voice was \\nguarded. “Paulie was sick, he had a cold, so he stayed home.  He’s been a little sick all \\nwinter.” \\nSonny was instantly alert. “How many time s did he stay home the last couple of \\nmonths?” \\n“Maybe three or four times,” Clemenza said. “I always asked Freddie if he wanted another guy but he said  no. There’s been no cause, t he last ten years things been \\nsmooth, you know.” \\n“Yeah,” Sonny said. “I’ll see you at my father ’s house. Be sure you bring Paulie. Pick \\nhim up on your way over. I don’t care how si ck he is. You got that?” He slammed down \\nthe phone without waiting for an answer. \\nHis wife was weeping silently. He  stared at her for a moment, then said in a harsh voice, \\n“Any of our people call, tell them to get me in my father’s house on his special phone. \\nAnybody else call, you don’t know nothing. If To m’s wife calls, tell he r that Tom won’t be \\nhome for a while, he’s on business.” \\nHe pondered for a moment. “A couple of our peopl e will come to stay here.” He saw her  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 70\\nlook of fright and said impati ently, “You don’t have to be scar ed, I just want them here. \\nDo whatever they tell you to do. If you want a talk to me, get me on Pop’s special phone \\nbut don’t call me unless it’s really important. And don’t worry.” He went out of the house. \\nDarkness had fallen and the De cember wind whipped thr ough the mall. Sonny had no \\nfear about stepping out into the night. All eight houses were owned by Don Corleone. At \\nthe mouth of the mall the two houses on either side were rented by family retainers with \\ntheir own families and star boarders, single men who lived in the basement apartments. \\nOf the remaining six houses t hat formed the rest of the hal f circle; one was inhabited by \\nTom Hagen and his family, his own, and the smallest and least ostentatious by the Don \\nhimself. The other three houses were given rent -free to retired friends of the Don with \\nthe understanding that they  would be vacated whenever he requested. The \\nharmless-looking mall was an impregnable fortress. \\nAll eight houses were equip ped with floodlights which bat hed the grounds around them \\nand made the mall impossible to lurk in. Sonny went across the street to his father’s \\nhouse and let himself inside with his own key.  He yelled out, “Ma, where are you?” and \\nhis mother came out of the kitchen. Behind her rose the sme ll of frying peppers. Before \\nshe could say anything, Sonny took her by the arm and made her sit down. “I just got a \\ncall,” he said. “Now don’t get worried. Pop’s in the hospital , he’s hurt. Get dressed and \\nget ready to get down there. I ’ll have a car and a driver for you in a little while. OK?” \\nHis mother looked at him steadily for a mo ment and then asked in Italian, “Have they \\nshot him?” \\nSonny nodded. His mother bowed  her head for a moment. Then she went back into the \\nkitchen. Sonny followed her. He watched her  turn off the gas under the panful of \\npeppers and then go out and up to the bedr oom. He took peppers from the pan and \\nbread from the basket on the table and made a sloppy sandwich with hot olive oil \\ndripping from his fingers. He went into the huge corner room that wa s his father’s office \\nand took the special phone from a locked c abinet box. The phone had been especially \\ninstalled and was listed under a phony name and a phony addr ess. The first person he \\ncalled was Luca Brasi. There was no an swer. Then he called the safety-valve \\ncaporegime in Brooklyn, a man of unquestioned loyalty to the Don. This man’s name \\nwas Tessio. Sonny told him what had hap pened and what he wanted. Tessio was to \\nrecruit fifty absolutely reliable men. He was to send guards to the hospital, he was to \\nsend men out to Long Beach to work here. Te ssio asked, “Did they  get Clemenza too?” \\nSonny said, “I don’t want to use Clemen za’s people right now.” Tessio understood  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 71\\nimmediately, there was a paus e, and then he said, “Excuse me, Sonny, I say this as \\nyour father would say it. Don’t move too fast. I can’t believe Clemenza would betray us.” \\n“Thanks,” Sonny said. “I don’t think so  but I have to be careful. Right?” \\n“Right,” Tessio said. \\n“Another thing,” Sonny said. “My kid brother  Mike goes to college in Hanover, New \\nHampshire. Get some people we know in Bo ston to go up and get him and bring him \\ndown here to the house until this blows over. I’ll call him up so he’ll expect them. Again \\nI’m just playing the percent ages, just to make sure.” \\n“OK,” Tessio said, “I’ll be over  your father’s house as soon as I get things rolling. OK? \\nYou know my boys, right?” \\n“Yeah,” Sonny said. He hung up. He went ov er to a small wall safe and unlocked it. \\nFrom it he took an indexed book bound in blue leather. He opene d it to the T’s until he \\nfound the entry he was looking for. It read, “Ray Farre ll $5,000 Christmas Eve.” This \\nwas followed by a telephone number. Sonny dialed the number and said, “Farrell?” The \\nman on the other end answered, “Yes.” Sonny said, “This is  Santino Corleone. I want \\nyou to do me a favor and I want you to do it right away. I want you to check two phone numbers and give me all the call s they got and all the calls t hey made for the last three \\nmonths.” He gave Farrell the number of Paulie Gatto’s home and Clemenza’s home. \\nThen he said, “This is important. Get it to me before midnight and you’ll have an extra \\nvery Merry Christmas.” \\nBefore he settled back to think things out he  gave Luca Brasi’s number one more call. \\nAgain there was no answer. This worried him but he put it out of his mind. Luca would \\ncome to the house as soon as he heard t he news. Sonny leaned back in the swivel \\nchair. In an hour the house would be swarmi ng with Family people and he would have to \\ntell them all what to do, and now that he finall y had time to think he  realized how serious \\nthe situation was. It was the first challenge to  the Corleone Family and their power in ten \\nyears. There was no doubt that Sollozzo was behind it, but he would never have dared attempt such a stroke unless he had support from at least one of the five great New \\nYork families. And that support must have come from the Tattaglias. Which meant a full-scale war or an immediat e settlement on Sollozzo’s te rms. Sonny smiled grimly. The \\nwily Turk had planned well but  he had been unlucky. The old man was alive and so it \\nwas war. With Luca Brasi and the resources of the Corleone Family there could be but \\none outcome. But again the nagging worry. Where was Luca Brasi?  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 72\\nChapter 3   \\nCounting the driver, there were four men in the car with Hagen.  They put him in the back \\nseat, in the middle of the two men who had come up behind him in the street. Sollozzo \\nsat up front. The man on Hagen’s right reach ed over across his body and tilted Hagen’s \\nhat over his eyes so that he could not s ee. “Don’t even move your pinkie,” he said. \\nIt was a short ride, not more  than twenty minutes and when they got out of the car \\nHagen could not recognize the neighborho od because darkness had fallen. They led \\nhim into a basement apartment and made him sit on a straightbacked kitchen chair. \\nSollozzo sat across the kitchen table from him.  His dark face had a peculiarly vulturine \\nlook. \\n“I don’t want you to be afraid,” he said. “I know you’re not in the muscle end of the Family. I want you to help the Corl eones and I want you to help me.” \\nHagen’s hands were shaking as  he put a cigarette in his m outh. One of t he men brought \\na bottle of rye to the table and gave him a slug of it in a china coffee cup. Hagen drank \\nthe fiery liquid gratefully. It steadied his hand and took the weakness out of his legs. \\n“Your boss is dead,” Sollozzo said. He paused, surprised at the tears that sprang to Hagen’s eyes. Then he went on. “We got him out side his office, in the street. As soon as \\nI got the word, I picked you up. You have to make the peace between me and Sonny.” \\nHagen didn’t answer. He was surprised at his own grief. And the feeling of desolation \\nmixed with his fear of death.  Sollozzo was speaking again. “Sonny was hot for my deal. \\nRight? You know it’s the smart thing to do too.  Narcotics is the coming thing. There’s so \\nmuch money in it that everybody can get rich  just in a couple of years. The Don was an \\nold ‘Moustache Pete,’ his day was over but he didn’t know it. No w he’s dead, nothing \\ncan bring him back. I’m ready to make a new deal, I want you to talk Sonny into taking \\nit.” \\nHagen said, “You haven’t got a chance. Sonny will come after you with everything he’s got.” \\nSollozzo said impatiently, “That’s gonna be hi s first reaction. You have to talk some \\nsense to him. The Tattaglia Family stands  behind me with all th eir people. The other \\nNew York families will go alon g with anything that will stop a full-scale war between us. \\nOur war has to hurt them and their businesse s. If Sonny goes along with the deal, the \\nother Families in the country will consider it none of their affair, even the Don’s oldest  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 73\\nfriends.” \\nHagen stared down at his hands, not answering. Sollozzo went on persuasively. “The \\nDon was slipping. In the old days I could never have gotten to him. The other Families \\ndistrust him because he made you his Consigli ere and you’re not even Italian, much \\nless Sicilian. If it goes to all-out war t he Corleone Family will be smashed and everybody \\nloses, me included. I need the Family polit ical contacts more than I need the money \\neven. So talk to Sonny, talk to the c aporegimes; you’ll save a lot of bloodshed.” \\nHagen held out his china cup for more whiskey. “I’ll try,” he said. “But Sonny is \\nstrong-headed. And even Sonny won’t be able to  call off Luca. You have to worry about \\nLuca. I’ll have to worry about Luca if I go for your deal.” \\nSollozzo said quietly, “I’ll take care of Luc a. You take care of Sonny and the other two \\nkids. Listen, you can tell them that Freddie would have gotten it today with his old man \\nbut my people had strict orders not to gun him. I didn’t want any more hard feelings than necessary. You can tell them that, Freddie is alive because of me.” \\nFinally Hagen’s mind was working. For the first time he really believed that Sollozzo did \\nnot mean to kill him or hold him as a hostage.  The sudden relief from fear that flooded \\nhis body made him flush with shame. Sollozzo  watched him with a quiet understanding \\nsmile. Hagen began to think things out. If he did not agree to argue Sollozzo’s case, he might be killed. But then he realized that Sollozzo expected him only to present it and present it properly, as he wa s bound to do as a responsible  Consigliere. And now, \\nthinking about it, he also realized that So llozzo was right. An unlimited war between the \\nTattaglias and the Corleones must be avoided at  all costs. The Co rleones must bury \\ntheir dead and forget, make a deal. And then w hen the time was right they could move \\nagainst Sollozzo. \\nBut glancing up, he realized that Sollozzo k new exactly what he was thinking. The Turk \\nwas smiling. And then it st ruck Hagen. What had happened to Luca Brasi that Sollozzo \\nwas so unconcerned? Had Luca made a deal? He remembered that on the night Don \\nCorleone had refused Sollozzo, Luca had been summoned into the office for a private \\nconference with the Don. But now was not the time to worry about such details. He had \\nto get back to the safety of the Corleone Fam ily fortress in Long Beach. “I’ll do my best,” \\nhe said to Sollozzo. “I believe you’re right, it ’s even what the Don w ould want us to do.” \\nSollozzo nodded gravely. “Fine,” he said. “I don’t like bloodshed, I’m a businessman and \\nblood costs too much money.” At that moment the phone rang  and one of the men  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 74\\nsitting behind Hagen went to answer it. He lis tened and then said curtly, “OK, I’ll tell \\nhim.” He hung up the phone, went to Sollozzo’s side and whispered in the Turk’s ear. \\nHagen saw Sollozzo’s face go pale, his eyes glitter with rage. He himself felt a thrill of \\nfear. Sollozzo was looking at him speculat ively and suddenly Hagen knew that he was \\nno longer going to be set free. That so mething had happened that might mean his \\ndeath. Sollozzo said, “The old marl is still aliv e. Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he’s \\nstill alive.” He gave a fatalistic shrug. “B ad luck,” he said to Hagen. “Bad luck for me. \\nBad luck for you.” \\nChapter 4  \\nWhen Michael Corleone arrived at his fat her’s house in Long Beach he found the narrow \\nentrance mouth of the mall bloc ked off with a link chain. The mall itself was bright with \\nthe floodlights of all eight houses, outlining at  least ten cars parked along the curving \\ncement walk. \\nTwo men he didn’t know were leaning again st the chain. One of  them asked in a \\nBrooklyn accent, “Who’re you?” \\nHe told them. Another man came out of  the nearest house and peered at his face. \\n“That’s the Don’s kid,” he said. “I’ll bring hi m inside.” Mike followed this man to his \\nfather’s house, where two men at the door let him and his escort pass inside. \\nThe house seemed to be full of men he didn’t know, until he went into the living room. There Michael saw Tom Hagen’s wife, Theres a, sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a \\ncigarette. On the coffee table in front of her was a glass of whiskey. On the other side of \\nthe sofa sat the bulky Clemenza. The caporegime’s face was impassive, but he was \\nsweating and the cigar in his hand glistened slickly black with his saliva. \\nClemenza came to wring his hand in a consolin g way, muttering, “Your mother is at the \\nhospital with your father, he’s going to be all right.” Paulie Gatto stood up to shake \\nhands. Michael looked at him curiously. He knew Paulie was his father’s bodyguard but \\ndid not know that Paulie had stayed home si ck that day. But he sensed tension in the \\nthin dark face. He knew Gatto’s reputation as an up-and-coming man, a very quick man \\nwho knew how to get delicat e jobs done without complica tions, and today he had failed \\nin his duty. He noticed several other men in the corners of the room but he did not \\nrecognize them. They were not of Clemenza’ s people. Michael put these facts together \\nand understood. Clemenza and Gatto were sus pect. Thinking that Paulie had been at \\nthe scene, he asked the ferret-faced y oung man, “How is Freddie? He OK?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 75\\n“The doctor gave him a shot,” Clemenza said. “He’s sleeping.” \\nMichael went to Hagen’s wife and bent dow n to kiss her cheek. They had always liked \\neach other. He whispered, “Don’t worry, Tom will be OK. Have you talked to Sonny \\nyet?” \\nTheresa clung to him for a moment and shook her  head. She was a delicate, very pretty \\nwoman, more American than Italian, and very scared. He took her hand and lifted her off \\nthe sofa. Then he led her into his father’s corner room office. \\nSonny was sprawled out in hi s chair behind the desk hold ing a yellow pad in one hand \\nand a pencil in the other. The only other man in the room with him was the caporegime \\nTessio, whom Michael recognized and immediately realized that it must be his men who \\nwere in the house and forming the new palac e guard. He too had a pencil and pad in his \\nhands. \\nWhen Sonny saw them he came from behind his desk and took Hagen’s wife in his \\narms. “Don’t worry, Theresa,” he said. “Tom ’s OK. They just wanta give him the \\nproposition, they said they’d turn him loose.  He’s not on the operating end, he’s just our \\nlawyer. There’s no reason for anybody to do him harm.” \\nHe released Theresa and then to Michael’s surprise he too, got a hug and a kiss on the \\ncheek. He pushed Sonny aw ay and said grinning, “After I get used to you beating me up \\nI gotta put up with this?” They had o ften fought when they were younger. \\nSonny shrugged. “Listen, kid, I was worried when I couldn’t get ahold of you in that hick \\ntown. Not that I gave a crap if they knocked y ou off, but I didn’t like the idea of bringing \\nthe news to the old lady. I had to tell her about Pop.” \\n“How’d she take it?” Michael asked. \\n“Good,” Sonny said. “She’s been through it befor e. Me too. You were too young to know \\nabout it and then th ings got pretty smith while you were growing up.” He paused and \\nthen said, “She’s down at the hospital wit h the old man. He’s gonna pull through.” \\n“How about us going down?” Michael asked. \\nSonny shook his head and said dryly, “I can’ t leave this house until it’s all over.” The \\nphone rang. Sonny picked it up and listened in tently. While he was listening Michael \\nsauntered over to the desk and  glanced down at the yell ow pad Sonny had  been writing \\non. There was a list of seven names. The first three were Sollozzo, Phillip Tattaglia, and \\nJohn Tattaglia. It struck Michael with full fo rce that he had interrupted Sonny and Tessio  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 76\\nas they were making up a list of men to be killed. \\nWhen Sonny hung up the phone he said to T heresa Hagen and Michael, “Can you two \\nwait outside? I got some business with Tessio we have to finish.” \\nHagen’s wife said, “Was that call about Tom?” She said it almost truculently but she was \\nweeping with fright. Sonny put his arm around her and led her to the door. “I swear he’s \\ngoing to be OK,” he said. “Wait in the living room. I’ll come out as soon as I hear something.” He shut the door behind her. Mi chael had sat down in one of the big leather \\narmchairs. Sonny gave him a quick sharp look  and then went to sit down behind the \\ndesk. \\n“You hang around me, Mike,” he said, “you’re gonna hear things you don’t wanta hear.” \\nMichael lit a cigarette. “I can help out,” he said. \\n“No, you can’t,” Sonny said. “The old man woul d be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up \\nin this.” \\nMichael stood up and yelled. “You lousy basta rd, he’s my father. I’m not supposed to \\nhelp him? I can help. I don’t have to go out and kill people but I can help. Stop treating \\nme like a kid brother. I was in the war. I go t shot, remember? I killed some Japs. What \\nthe hell do you think I’ll do when you knock somebody off? Faint?” \\nSonny grinned at him. “Pretty soon you’ll want  me to put up my dukes. OK, stick around, \\nyou can handle the phone.” He turned to Tessi o. “That call I just got gave me dope we \\nneeded.” Hd turned to Michael. “Somebody had to  finger the old man. It could have \\nbeen Clemenza, it could have b een Paulie Gatto, who was very conveniently sick today. \\nI know the answer now, let’s see how smart you are, Mike , you’re the college boy. Who \\nsold out to Sollozzo?” \\nMichael sat down again and relaxed back into the leat her armchair. He thought \\neverything over very carefully. Clemenza wa s a caporegime in the Corleone Family \\nstructure. Don Corleone had made him a millionaire and t hey had been intimate friends \\nfor over twenty years. He held one of the most powerful posts  in the organization. What \\ncould Clemenza gain for betra ying his Don? More money? He  was rich enough but then \\nmen are always greedy. More power? Revenge fo r some fancied insult or slight? That \\nHagen had been made the Co nsigliere? Or perhaps a businessman’s conviction that \\nSollozzo would win out? No, it was impossible for Clemenz a to be a traitor, and then \\nMichael thought sadly it was only impossible because he didn’t  want Clemenza to die. \\nThe fat man had always brought him gifts when he was growing up, had sometimes  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 77\\ntaken him on outings when the Don had been too busy. He  could not believe that \\nClemenza was guilty of treachery. \\nBut, on the other hand, Sollozzo would want Clemenza in his pocket more than any \\nother man in the Corleone Family. \\nMichael thought about Paulie Gatto. Paulie as yet had not become rich. He was well \\nthought of, his rise in the organization was cert ain but he would have to put in his time \\nlike everybody else. Also he would have wilder  dreams of power, as the young always \\ndo. It had to be Paulie. And th en Michael remembered that in the sixth grade he and \\nPaulie had been in the same class in school and he didn’t want it to be Paulie either. \\nHe shook his head. “Neither one of them,” he said. But he said it only because Sonny \\nhad said he had the answer. If it had been a vote, he would have voted Paulie guilty. \\nSonny was smiling at him. “Don’t worry,” he said. “Clemenza is OK. It’s Paulie.” \\nMichael could see that Tessio was relieved.  As a fellow caporegime his sympathy would \\nbe with Clemenza. Also the pres ent situation was not so serious if treachery did not \\nreach so high. Tessio said cautiously, “Then I can send my people home tomorrow?” \\nSonny said, “The day after tomorrow. I don’t want anybody to know about this until then. Listen, I want to talk some family busines s with my brother, personal. Wait out in the \\nliving room, eh? We can finish our list later.  You and Ctemenza will work together on it.” \\n“Sure,” Tessio said. He went out. \\n“How do you know for sure it ’s Paulie?” Michael asked. \\nSonny said, “We have people in the telephone company and they tracked down all of \\nPaulie’s phone calls in and out. Clemenza’s too.  On the three days Paulie was sick this \\nmonth he got a call from a st reet booth across from the old man’s building. Today too. \\nThey were checking to see if Paulie wa s coming down or somebody was being sent \\ndown to take his place. Or for some other  reason. It doesn’t matter.” Sonny shrugged. \\n“Thank God it was Paulie. We’ll need Clemenza bad.” \\nMichael asked hesitantly, “Is it going to be an all-out war?” \\nSonny’s eyes were hard. “That’s how I’m going to play it as soon as Tom checks in. Until the old man tells me different.” \\nMichael asked, “So why don’t you wait until the old man can tell you?” \\nSonny looked at him curiously. “How the hell did you win those combat medals? We are  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 78\\nunder the gun, man, we gotta fight. I’m just afraid they won’t let Tom go.” \\nMichael was surprised at this. “Why not?” \\nAgain Sonny’s voice was patient. “They snatched Tom because they figured the old \\nman was finished and they could make a deal with me and Tom would be the sit-down \\nguy in the preliminar y stages, carry the proposition. No w with the old man alive they \\nknow I can’t make a deal so Tom’s no good to  them. They can turn him loose or dump \\nhim, depending how Sollozzo feels.  If they dump him, it would be just to show us they \\nreally mean business, trying to bulldoze us.” \\nMichael said quietly, “What made Sollozzo think he could get a deal with you?” \\nSonny flushed and he didn’t answer for a moment. Then he said, “We had a meeting a \\nfew months ago, Sollozzo came to us with a proposition on drugs. The old man turned \\nhim down. But during the meet ing I shot off my mouth a little, I showed I wanted the \\ndeal. Which is absolutely the wrong thing to  do; if there’s one thing the old man \\nhammered into me it’s never, to do a thing lik e that, to let other people know there’s a \\nsplit of opinion in the Family. So Sollozzo figu res he gets rid of the old man, I have to go \\nin with him on the drugs. With t he old man gone, the Fa mily power is cut at least in half. \\nI would be fighting for my life anyway to  keep all the busines ses the old man got \\ntogether. Drugs are the coming thing, we should get into it. And his knocking off the old \\nman is purely business, nothing personal. As  a matter of business I would go in with \\nhim. Of course he would never let me get t oo close, he’d make sure I’d never get a \\nclean shot at him, just in case. But he also knows that once I accepted the deal the \\nother Families would never let me start a war a couple of years later just for revenge. \\nAlso, the Tattaglia Family is behind him.” \\n“If they had gotten the old man, what would you have done?” Michael asked. \\nSonny said very simply, “Sollozzo is dead mea t. I don’t care what it costs. I don’t care if \\nwe have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia Family is going to be wiped out. I don’t care if we all go down together.” \\nMichael said softly, “That’s not  how Pop would have played it.” \\nSonny made a violent gesture. “I know I’m no t the man he was. But I’ll tell you this and \\nhe’ll tell you too. When it comes to r eal action I can operate as good as anybody, \\nshort-range. Sollozzo knows that and so do Clemenza and Tessio, I ‘made my bones’ \\nwhen I was nineteen, the last time the Family had a war, and I was a big help to the old \\nman. So I’m not worried now. And our Family has  all the horses in a deal like this. I just  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 79\\nwish we could get contact with Luca.” \\nMichael asked curiously, “Is Luca that tough, like they say? Is he that good?” \\nSonny nodded. “He’s in a class by himsel f. I’m going to send hi m after the three \\nTattaglias. I’ll get Sollozzo myself.” \\nMichael shifted uneasily in his chair. He lo oked at his older brot her. He remembered \\nSonny as being sometimes casually brutal but essentially warmhear ted. A nice guy. It \\nseemed unnatural to hear him talking this way,  it was chilling to see the list of names he \\nhad scribbled down, men to  be executed, as if he we re some newly crowned Roman \\nEmperor. He was glad that he was not truly par t of all this, that now his father lived he \\ndid not have to involve himself in veng eance. He’d help out, answering the phone, \\nrunning errands and messages. S onny and the old man could ta ke care of themselves, \\nespecially with Luca behind them. \\nAt that moment they  heard a woman scream in the liv ing room. Oh, Christ, Michael \\nthought, it sounded like Tom’s wife. He rushed to the door and opened it. Everybody in \\nthe living room was standing. And by the so fa Tom Hagen was holding Theresa close to \\nhim, his face embarrassed. Theresa was w eeping and sobbing, and Michael realized \\nthat the scream he had heard had been her calling out her hus band’s name with joy. As \\nhe watched, Tom Hagen disentangled himsel f from his wife’s arms and lowered her \\nback onto the sofa. He smiled at Michael grimly. “Glad to see you, Mike, really glad.” He \\nstrode into the office without another look at his still-sobbing wife. He hadn’t lived with \\nthe Corleone Family ten years for nothing, Michael thought with a queer  flush of pride. \\nSome of the old man had rubbed off on hi m, as it had on Sonny, and he thought, with \\nsurprise, even on himself. \\nChapter 5  \\nIt was nearly four o’clock in the morning as they  all sat in the corner room office– Sonny, \\nMichael, Tom Hagen, Clemenza and Tessio. Theresa Hagen had been persuaded to go \\nto her own home next door. Paulie Gatto was st ill waiting in the living room, not knowing \\nthat Tessio’s men had been instructed not to let him leave or let him out of their sight. \\nTom Hagen relayed the deal Sollozzo offered. He told how after Sollozzo had learned \\nthe Don still lived, it was obvious that he m eant to kill Hagen. Hagen grinned. “If I ever \\nplead before the Supreme Court, I’ll never pl ead better than I did with that goddamn \\nTurk tonight. I told him I’d talk the Family into the deal even though the Don was alive. I \\ntold him I could wrap you around my finger, Sonny. How we were buddies as kids; and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 80\\ndon’t get sore, but I let him get the idea that  maybe you weren’t too sorry about getting \\nthe old man’s job, God forgive me.” He sm iled apologetically at Sonny, who made a \\ngesture signifying that he understood, that it was of no consequence. \\nMichael, leaning back in his armchair with the phone at his right hand, studied both men. \\nWhen Hagen had entered the room Sonny had co me rushing to embrace him. Michael \\nrealized with a faint twinge of jealousy that in many ways Sonny and Tom Hagen were \\ncloser than he himself could ever be to his own brother. \\n“Let’s get down to business,” Sonny said. “We have to make plans. Take a look at this \\nlist me and Tessio made up. Tessio, give Clemenza your copy.” \\n“If we make plans,” Michael said, “Freddie should be here.” \\nSonny said grimly, “Freddie is  no use to us. The doctor says he’s in shock so bad he \\nhas to have complete rest. I don’t understand that. Freddie was always a pretty tough \\nguy. I guess seeing the old man gunned down was hard on him, he always thought the \\nDon was God. He wasn’t like you and me, Mike.” \\nHagen said quickly, “OK, leave Freddie ou t. Leave him out of ev erything, absolutely \\neverything. Now, Sonny, until this  is all over I think you shoul d stay in the house. I mean \\nsever leave it. You’re safe here. Don’ t underrate Sollozzo, he’s got to be a \\npezzonovante, a real.90 caliber . Is the hospital covered?” \\nSonny nodded. “The cops have it locked in and I got my people there vi siting Pop all the \\ntime. What do you think of that list, Tom?” \\nHagen frowned down at the fist of names: “Jesus Christ, S onny, you’re really taking this \\npersonal. The Don would consider it a purely business dispute. Sollo zzo is the key. Get \\nrid of Sollozzo and everything falls in line. You don’t have to go after the Tattaglias.” \\nSonny looked at his two caporegimes. Tessio  shrugged. “It’s tricky,” he said. Clemenza \\ndidn’t answer at all. \\nSonny said to Clemenza, “One thing we can take care of without discussion. I don’t want Paulie around here anymore. Ma ke that first on your lis t.” The fat caporegime nodded. \\nHagen said, “What about Luca? Sollozzo didn’t seem worried about Luca. That worries me. If Luca sold us out, we’re in real trouble. That’s the first thing we have to know. Has \\nanybody been able to get in touch with him?” \\n“No,” Sonny said. “I’ve been calling him all night. Maybe he’s shacked up.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 81\\n“No,” Hagen said. “He never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he’s \\nthrough. Mike, keep ringing his number until you get an answer.” Michael dutifully picked \\nup the phone and dialed. He could hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one \\nanswered. Finally he hung up. “Keep trying every fifteen minutes,” Hagen said. \\nSonny said impatiently, “OK, Tom you’re t he Consigliere, how about some advice? What \\nthe hell do you think we should do?” \\nHagen helped himself to the whiskey bottle on the desk. “We negotiate with Sollozzo \\nuntil your father is in shape to  take charge. We might even make a deal if we have to. \\nWhen your father gets out of bed he can settl e the whole business without a fuss and all \\nthe Families will go along with him.” \\nSonny said angrily, “You think I can’t handle this guy Sollozzo?” \\nTom Hagen looked him directly in the ey e. “Sonny, sure you can outfight him. The \\nCorleone Family has the power. You have Clemenza and Tessio here and they can \\nmuster a thousand men if it comes to an a ll-out war. But at t he end there will be a \\nshambles over the whole East Coast and all the other Families will blame the \\nCorleones. We’ll make a lot of enemies. And that’s something your father never believed \\nin.” \\nMichael, watching Sonny, thought he took th is well. But then Sonny said to Hagen, \\n“What if the old man dies, what do you advise then, Consigliere?” \\nHagen said quietly, “I know you won’t do it, but  I would advise you to make a real deal \\nwith Sollozzo on the drugs. Without your father’s polit ical contacts and personal \\ninfluence the Corleone Family loses half its st rength. Without your father, the other New \\nYork Families might wind up supporting the Ta ttaglias and Sollozzo just to make sure \\nthere isn’t a long destructive war. If your father dies, make the deal. Then wait and see.” \\nSonny was white-faced with anger. “That’s easy for you to say, it’s not your father they \\nkilled.” \\nHagen said quickly and proudly, “I was as good a son to him as you or Mike, maybe better. I’m giving you a profe ssional opinion. Personally I want  to kill all those bastards.” \\nThe emotion in his voice shamed Sonny, who sa id, “Oh, Christ, Tom, I didn’t mean it \\nthat way.” But he had, really. Blood was blood and nothing else was its equal. \\nSonny brooded for a moment as the others wa ited in embarrassed silence. Then he \\nsighed and spoke quietly. “OK, we’ll sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But,  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 82\\nTom, I want you to stay in side the mall, too. Don’t take any chances. Mike, you be \\ncareful, though I don’t think. even Sollozzo would bring personal fa mily into the war. \\nEverybody would be against hi m then. But be careful. Tessi o, you hold your people in \\nreserve but have them nosing around the city . Clemenza, after you settle the Paulie \\nGatto thing, you move your men into the house and the mall to r eplace Tessio’s people. \\nTessio, you keep your men at the hospital,  though. Tom, start negotiation over the \\nphone or by messenger with Sollozzo and the Ta ttaglias the first thing in the morning. \\nMike, tomorrow you take a couple of Cle menza’s people and go to Luca’s house and \\nwait for him to show up or find out where t he hell he is. That cr azy bastard might be \\ngoing after Sollozzo right now if he’s heard the news. I can’t believe he’d ever go against \\nhis Don, no matter what the Turk offered him.” \\nHagen said reluctantly, “Maybe Mike shouldn’t  get mixed up in this so directly.” \\n“Right,” Sonny said. “Forget that, Mike. An yway I need you on the phone here in the \\nhouse, that’s more important.” \\nMichael didn’t say anything. He felt awkward, almost ashamed, and he noticed \\nClemenza and Tessio with faces so carefully im passive that he was su re that they were \\nhiding their contempt. He picked up the phone and dialed Luc a Brasi’s number and kept \\nthe receiver to his ear  as it rang and rang. \\nChapter 6  \\nPeter Clemenza slept badly that night. In th e morning he got up early and made his own \\nbreakfast of a glass of grappa, a thick slice of Genoa salami with a chunk of fresh Italian \\nbread that was still de livered to his door as in the old days. Then he drank a great, plain \\nchina mug filled with hot coffee that had been lashed with anisette. But as he padded \\nabout the house in his old bathrobe and red fe lt slippers he ponder ed on the day’s work \\nthat lay ahead of him. Last night Sonny Co rleone had made it very clear that Paulie \\nGatto was to be taken care of immediately. It had to be today. \\nClemenza was troubled. Not because Ga tto had been his protege and had turned \\ntraitor. This did not reflec t on the caporegime’s judgment. A fter all, Paulie’s background \\nhad been perfect. He came from a Sicilian family, he had grown up in the same \\nneighborhood as the Corleone children, had indeed even gone to school with one of the \\nsons. He had been brought up through each le vel in the proper manner. He had been \\ntested and not found wanting. And then afte r he had “made his bones” he had received \\na good living from the Family, a percentage of an East Side  “book” and a union payroll  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 83\\nslot. Clemenza had not been unaw are that Paulie Gatto ‘sup plemented his income with \\nfree-lance stickups, strictly against the Family rules, but even this was a sign of the \\nman’s worth. The breaking of such regulations was considered a sign of \\nhigh-spiritedness, like that shown by a fine racing horse fighting the reins. \\nAnd Paulie had never caused trouble with his stickups. They had always been \\nmeticulously planned and carried out with t he minimum of fuss and trouble, with no one \\never getting hurt: a three-thousand-dollar Manhattan garment center  payroll, a small \\nchinaware factory payroll in t he slums of Brooklyn. After a ll, a young man could always \\nuse some extra pocket money. It was all in the pattern. Who could ever foretell that \\nPaulie Gatto would turn traitor? \\nWhat was troubling Peter Clemenza this mo rning was an administrative problem. The \\nactual execution of Gatto was a cut-and-dried chore. The problem was, who should the \\ncaporegime bring up from the r anks to replace Gatto in the Family? It was an important \\npromotion, that to “button”  man, one not to be handed out lightly. The man had to be \\ntough and he had to be smart. He had to be safe, not a person who would talk to the \\npolice if he got in trouble, one well saturated in the Sicili ans’ law of omerta, the law of \\nsilence. And then, what kind of a living w ould he receive for his new duties? Clemenza \\nhad several times spoken to the Don about be tter rewards for the all-important button \\nman who was first in the front line when tr ouble arose, but the Don had put him off. If \\nPaulie had been making more money, he might have been able to resist the blandishments of the wily Turk, Sollozzo. \\nClemenza finally narrowed down the list of candidates to three men. The first was an \\nenforcer who worked with the colored policy bank ers in Harlem, a big brawny brute of a \\nman of great physical strength,  a man with a great deal of personal charm who could get \\nalong with people and yet when necessary make them go in fear of him. But Clemenza \\nscratched him off the list after considering his name for a half hour. This man got along \\ntoo well with the black people, which hinted at  some flaw of character. Also he would be \\ntoo hard to replace in the position he now held. \\nThe second name Clemenza considered a nd almost settled on was a hard-working \\nchap who served faithfully and we ll in the organization. This man was the collector of \\ndelinquent accounts for Family-licensed shylocks in Manhattan. He had started off as a \\nbookmaker’s runner. But he was not quite yet ready for such an important promotion. \\nFinally he settled on Rocco Lampone. Lampone had served a short but impressive  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 84\\napprenticeship in the Family . During the war he had been wounded in Africa and been \\ndischarged in 1943. Because of the short age of young men, Clemenza had taken him \\non even though Lampone was partially incapacit ated by his injuries and walked with a \\npronounced limp. Clemenza had used him as a black-market contact in the garment \\ncenter and with gover nment employees controlling O PA food stamps. From that, \\nLampone had graduated to trouble- shooter for the whole oper ation. What Clemenza \\nliked about him was his good judgment. He knew that there was no percentage in being \\ntough about something that woul d only cost a heavy fine or six months in jail, small \\nprices to pay for the enormous  profits earned. He had the goo d sense to know that it \\nwas not an area for heavy threats but light ones. He kept the whole operation in a minor \\nkey, which was exactly what was needed. \\nClemenza felt the relief of a conscientious  administrator who has  solved a knotty \\npersonnel problem. Yes, it would be Rocco Lampone who would assist. For Clemenza \\nplanned to handle this job himself, not only to  help a new, inexperienced man “make his \\nbones,” but to settle a personal score with Paul ie Gatto. Paulie had been his protege, he \\nhad advanced Paulie over the heads of more deserving and more loyal people, he had \\nhelped Paulie “make his bones” and furthered his career in every way. Paulie had not \\nonly betrayed the Family, he had betrayed hi s padrone, Peter Clemenza. This lack of \\nrespect had to be repaid. \\nEverything else was arranged. Paulie Gatto  had been instructed to pick him up at three \\nin the afternoon, and to pick him up with hi s own car, nothing hot. Now Clemenza took \\nup the telephone and dialed Rocco Lampone’s numbe r. He did not identify himself. He \\nsimply said, “Come to my house, I have an e rrand for you.” He was pleased to note that \\ndespite the early hour, Lampone’s voice was not  surprised or dazed with sleep and he \\nsimply said, “OK.” Good man. Clemenza added, “No rush, have your breakfast and \\nlunch first before you come see me. But not later than two in the afternoon.” \\nThere was another laconic OK on the ot her end and Clemenza hung up the phone. He \\nhad already alerted his people  about replacing caporegime Tessio’s people in the \\nCorleone mall so that was done. He had capable subordinates and never interfered in a \\nmechanical operation of that kind. \\nHe decided to wash his Cadillac. He loved the car. It gave him such a quiet peaceful \\nride, and its upholstery was so rich that he sometimes sat in it for an hour when the \\nweather was good because it was more pleas ant than sitting in the house. And it always \\nhelped him think when he was grooming the ca r. He remembered his father in Italy  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 85\\ndoing the same thing with donkeys. \\nClemenza worked inside the hea ted garage, he hated cold. He ran over his plans. You \\nhad to be careful with Paulie, the man was like  a rat, he could smell danger. And now of \\ncourse despite being so tough he must be shitting in his pants because the old man was \\nstill alive. He’d be as skittish as a donkey  with ants up his ass. But Clemenza was \\naccustomed to these circumstances, usual in  his work. First, he had to have a good \\nexcuse for Rocco to accompany them. Sec ond, he had to have a plausible mission for \\nthe three of them to go on. \\nOf course, strictly speaking, this was not ne cessary. Paulie Gatto could be killed without \\nany of these frills. He was locked in, he co uld not run away. But Clemenza felt strongly \\nthat it was important  to keep good working habits and never give away a fraction of a \\npercentage point. You never could tell what might happen and these matters were, after \\nall, questions of life and death. \\nAs he washed his baby-blue Cadillac, Peter Clemenza pondered and rehearsed his \\nlines, the expressions of his face. He woul d be curt with Paulie, as if displeased with \\nhim. With a man so sensitive and suspicious as Gatto this would throw him off the track \\nor at least leave him uncertain. Undue friend liness would make him wary. But of course \\nthe curtness must not be too angry. It had to be rather an absentminded sort of irritation. And why Lampone? Paulie would find that mo st alarming, especially since Lampone \\nhad to be in the rear seat. Paulie wouldn’t like being helpless at the wheel with Lampone \\nbehind his head. Clemenza rubbed and polished the metal of his Cadillac furiously. It \\nwas going to be tricky. Very tricky. For a moment he debated whether  to recruit another \\nman but decided against it. Here he followed basic reasoning. In years to come a situation might arise where it might be profitable for one of  his partners to testify against \\nhim. If there were just one accomplice it was one’s word against the other. But the word \\nof a second accomplice could swing the bal ance. No, they would stick to procedure. \\nWhat annoyed Clemenza was that  the execution had to be “public.” That is, the body \\nwas to be found. He would have much pref erred having it disappear. (Usual burying \\ngrounds were the nearby ocean or the swam plands of New Jersey on land owned by \\nfriends of the Family or by  other more complicated methods .) But it had to be public so \\nthat embryo traitors woul d be frightened and the enemy wa rned that the Corleone \\nFamily had by no means gone stupid or soft. So llozzo would be made wary by this quick \\ndiscovery of his spy. The Corleone Family would win back some of  its prestige. It had \\nbeen made to look foolish by the shooting of the old man.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 86\\nClemenza sighed. The Cadill ac gleamed like a huge bl ue steel egg, and he was \\nnowhere near the solving of his problem. Then the solution hit him, logical and to the \\npoint. It would explain Rocco Lampone, hims elf and Paulie being together and give \\nthem a mission of suffici ent secrecy and importance. \\nHe would tell Paulie that their job today wa s to find an apartment in case the Family \\ndecided to “go to the mattresses.” \\nWhenever a war between the Families became bitterly intense, the opponents would set \\nup headquarters in secret apar tments where the “soldiers”  could sleep on mattresses \\nscattered through the rooms. This was not so much to keep their families out of danger, \\ntheir wives and little children, since any attack on noncombatants was undreamed of. All \\nparties were too vulnerable to similar retalia tion. But it was always smarter to live in \\nsome secret place where your everyday move ments could not be char ted either by your \\nopponents or by some police who might  arbitrarily decide to meddle. \\nAnd so usually a trusted caporegime would be sent out to rent a secret apartment and \\nfill it with mattresses. That apar tment would be used as a sally port into the city when an \\noffensive was mounted. It was natural for Clemenza to be sent on such an errand. It \\nwas natural for him to take Gatto and Lampone with him to arrange all the details, \\nincluding the furnishing of the apartment. Al so, Clemenza thought wi th a grin, Paulie \\nGatto had proved he was greedy and the first thought that would p op into his head was \\nhow much he could get from Sollozzo for this valuable intelligence. \\nRocco Lampone arrived early and Clemenza ex plained what had to  be done and what \\ntheir roles would be. Lampone’s face lit up  with surprised gratitude and he thanked \\nClemenza respectfully for the promotion allowing him to serve the Family. Clemenza \\nwas sure he had done well. He clapped Lampone on the shoulder and said, “You’ll get \\nsomething better for your living after today. We’ll talk about that later. You understand \\nthe Family now is occupied with more critical  matters, more important things to do.” \\nLampone made a gesture that said he would be patient, knowing his reward was \\ncertain. \\nClemenza went to his den’s sa fe and opened it. He took out a gun and gave it to \\nLampone. “Use this one,” he said.. “They can never trace it. Leave it in the car with Paulie. When this job is finish ed I want you to take your wife and children on a vacation \\nto Florida. Use your own money  now and I’ll pay you back late r. Relax, get the sun. Use \\nthe Family hotel in Miami Beach so I’ll know where I can get you when I want.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 87\\nClemenza’s wife knocked on th e door of the den to tell t hem that Paulie Gatto had \\narrived. He was parked in the driveway. Clemenza led the way through the garage and \\nLampone followed him. When Clem enza got into the front s eat with Gatto he merely \\ngrunted in greeting, an exasperat ed look on his face. He look ed at his wristwatch as if \\nhe expected to find that Gatto was late. \\nThe ferret-faced button man was watching him in tently, looking for a clue. He flinched a \\nlittle when Lampone got into the rear seat b ehind him and said, “Rocco, sit on the other \\nsite. A big guy like you blocks up my rear-vie w mirror.” Lampone shifted dutifully, so that \\nhe was sitting behind Clemenza, as if such a request was the most natural thing in the \\nworld. \\nClemenza said sourly to Gatto, “Damn that Sonny, he’s running scared. He’s already \\nthinking of going to the mattresses. We have to find a place on t he West Side. Paulie, \\nyou and Rocco gotta staff and supply it until t he word comes down for the rest of the \\nsoldiers to use it. You know a good location?” \\nAs he had expected, Gatto’s ey es became greedily interested.  Paulie had swallowed the \\nbait and because he was thinking how much t he information was worth to Sollozzo, he \\nwas forgetting to think about whether he wa s in danger. Also, Lampone was acting his \\npart perfectly, staring out t he window in a disinterest ed, relaxed way. Clemenza \\ncongratulated himself on his choice. \\nGatto shrugged. “I’d have to  think about it,” he said. \\nClemenza grunted. “Drive while you think,  I want to get. to  New York today.” \\nPaulie was an expert driver and traffic going into the city was light at this time in the afternoon, so the early winter darkness was just beginning to fall when they arrived. \\nThere was no small talk in the car. Clemenza directed Paulie to drive up to the Washington Heights section. He checked a few apartment buildings and told him to park \\nnear Arthur Avenue and wait. He also left Rocco  Lampone in the car. He went into the \\nVera Mario Restaurant and had a light dinner of veal and sa lad, nodding his hellos to \\nsome acquaintances. After an hour had gone by he walked the several blocks to where \\nthe car was parked and entered it. Gatto and Lampone were still waiting. “Shit,” \\nClemenza said, “they want us back in Long Beach. They got some other job for us now. \\nSonny says we can let this one go until later.  Rocco, you live in the city, can we drop \\nyou off?” \\nRocco said quietly, “I have my car out at your  place and my old lady needs it first thing  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 88\\nin the morning.” \\n“That’s right,” Clemenza said. “Then you have to come back with us, after all.” \\nAgain on the ride back to Long  Beach nothing was said. On t he stretch of road that led \\ninto the city, Clemenza said suddenly, “Paulie, pull over, I gotta take a leak.” From \\nworking together so long, Gatto knew the fat caporegime had a weak bladder. He had \\noften made such a request. Gatto  pulled the car off the highwa y onto the soft earth that \\nled to the swamp. Clemenza climbed out of the car and t ook a few steps into the \\nbushes. He actually relieved himself. Then as  he opened the door to get back into the \\ncar he took a quick look up and down the highway. There were  no lights, the road was \\ncompletely dark. “Go ahead,” Cle menza said. A second later the interior of the car \\nreverberated with the report of a gun. Paulie Gatto seemed to jump forward, his body \\nflinging against the steering wh eel and then slumping over  to the seat. Clemenza had \\nstepped back hastily to avoid being hit with fragments of skull bone and blood. \\nRocco Lampone scrambled out of the back seat. He still hel d the gun and he threw it \\ninto the swamp. He and Clem enza walked hastily to a car parked nearby and got in. \\nLampone reached underneath the seat and found the key that had been left for them. \\nHe started the car and drove Clemenza to his home. Then in stead of going back by the \\nsame route, he took the Jones Beach Causew ay right on through to the town of Merrick \\nand onto the Meadowbrook Park way until he reached the Northern State Parkway. He \\nrode that to the Long Island Expressway and then continued on to the Whitestone \\nBridge and through the Bronx to  his home in Manhattan. \\n \\n \\nChapter 7  \\nOn the night before the shoot ing of Don Corleone, his st rongest and most loyal and \\nmost feared retainer prepar ed to meet with the enemy. Luca Brasi had made contact \\nwith the forces of Sollozzo several months before. He had done so on the orders of Don \\nCorleone himself. He had done so by frequent ing the nightclubs controlled by the \\nTattaglia Family and by taking up  with one of their top call girls.  In bed with this call girl \\nhe grumbled about how he was held down in the Corleone Family, how his worth was \\nnot recognized. After a week of this affair with the call girl, Luca was approached by Bruno Tattaglia, manager of the nightclub. Bruno was the younge st son, and ostensibly \\nnot connected with the Family business of pros titution. But his famous nightclub with its  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 89\\ndancing line of long-stemmed b eauties was the finishing school for many of the city \\nhookers. \\nThe first meeting was all above- board, Tattaglia offering him a job to work in the Family \\nbusiness as enforcer. The flirtation went on for nearly a month. Luca played his role of \\nman infatuated with a young b eautiful girl, Bruno Tattaglia the role of a businessman \\ntrying to recruit an able executive from a riva l. At one such meeting, Luca pretended to \\nbe swayed, then said, “But one thing must be understood. I will never go against the \\nGodfather. Don Corleone is a man I respect. I understand that he must put his sons \\nbefore me in the Family business.” \\nBruno Tattaglia was one of the new generation with a barely hidden contempt for the old \\nMoustache Petes like Luca Brasi, Don Corle one and even his own father. He was just a \\nlittle too respectful. Now he said, “My father wouldn’t expect you to do anything against \\nthe Corleones. Why should he? Everybody gets along with ever ybody else now, it’s not \\nlike the old days. It’s just that if you’re looking for a new j ob, I can pass along the word to \\nmy father. There’s always need  for a man like you in our bus iness. It’s a hard business \\nand it needs hard men to keep it running smooth.  Let me know if you ever make up your \\nmind.” \\nLuca shrugged. “It’s not so bad wher e I’m at.” And so they left it. \\nThe general idea had been to lead the Tattaglias to believe that he knew about the lucrative narcotics operation and that he wanted a piece of it free-lance. In that fashion \\nhe might hear something about Sollozzo’s plans if the Turk  had any, or whether he was \\ngetting ready to step on the toes of Don Co rleone. After waiting for two months with \\nnothing else happening, Luca repor ted to the Don that obviously Sollozzo was taking his \\ndefeat graciously. The Don had told him to keep trying but merely as a sideline, not to \\npress it. \\nLuca had dropped into the nightclub the ev ening before Don Corleone’s being shot. \\nAlmost immediately Bruno Tattaglia had come to his table and sat down. \\n“I have a friend who wants to talk to you,” he said. \\n“Bring him over,” Luca said. “I’ll talk to any friend of yours.” \\n“No,” Bruno said. “He wants to see you in private.” \\n“Who is he?” Luca asked. \\n“Just a friend of mine,” Bruno Tattaglia said. “H e wants to put a proposition to you. Can  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 90\\nyou meet him later on tonight?” \\n“Sure,” Luca said. “What time and where?” \\nTattaglia said softly, “The club closes at four  in the morning. Why don’t you meet in here \\nwhile the waiters are cleaning ups. \\nThey knew his habits, Luca thought, they must have been checking him out. He usually \\ngot up about three or four in the afternoon and had break fast, then amused himself by \\ngambling with cronies in the Family or had a girl. Sometimes he saw one of the midnight \\nmovies and then would drop in  for a drink at one of the cl ubs. He never went to bed \\nbefore dawn. So the suggestion of a four A.M. meeting was not as outlandish as it \\nseemed. \\n“Sure, sure,” he said. “I’ll be back at four.” He left the club and caught a cab to his \\nfurnished room on Tenth Avenue. He boarded with an Italian family to which he was \\ndistantly related. His two room s were separated from the rest of their railroad flat by a \\nspecial door. He liked the arra ngement because it gave him some family life and also \\nprotection against surprise where he was most vulnerable. \\nThe sly Turkish fox was going to show his bus hy tail, Luca thought. If things went far \\nenough, if Sollozzo committed himself tonigh t, maybe the whole thing could be wound \\nup as a Christmas present for the Don. In  his room, Luca unlocked the trunk beneath \\nthe bed and took out a bulletproof vest. It was heavy. He undressed and put it on over \\nhis woolen underwear, then put hi s shirt and jacket over it. He thought for a moment of \\ncalling the Don’s house at Long Beach to tell him of this new development but he knew \\nthe Don never talked over the phone, to  anyone, and the Don had given him this \\nassignment in secret and so did not want an yone, not even Hagen or his eldest son, to \\nknow about it. \\nLuca always carried a gun. He had a licens e to carry a gun, probably the most \\nexpensive gun license ever issued anyplace, anytime. It had cost a total of ten thousand \\ndollars but it would keep him out  of jail if he was frisked by the cops. As a top executive \\noperating official of the Family  he rated the license. But toni ght, just in case he could \\nfinish off the job, he wanted a “safe” gun. One that could not possibly be traced. But \\nthen thinking the matter over , he decided that he would just  listen to the proposition \\ntonight and report back to the Godfather, Don Corleone. \\nHe made his way back to the club but he di d not drink any more. Instead he wandered \\nout to 48th Street, where he had a leisurely late supper at Patsy’s, his favorite Italian  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 91\\nrestaurant. When it was time for his appointm ent he drifted uptown to the club entrance. \\nThe doorman was no longer ther e when he went in. The hat check girl was gone. Only \\nBruno Tattaglia waited to greet  him and lead him to the deser ted bar at the side of the \\nroom. Before him he could see the desert of small tables with the polished yellow wood \\ndance floor gleaming like a small diamond in the middle of them. In the shadows was \\nthe empty bandstand, out of it grew t he skeleton metal stalk of a microphone. \\nLuca sat at the bar and Bruno Tattaglia went behind it. Luca refused the drink offered to \\nhim and lit a cigarette. It was possible that this  would turn out to be something else, not \\nthe Turk. But then he saw Soltozzo emerge out  of the shadows at the far end of the \\nroom. \\nSollozzo shook his hand and sat at the bar next to him. Tattaglia put a glass in front of \\nthe Turk, who nodded his thanks. “Do you know who I am?” asked Sollozzo. \\nLuca nodded. He smiled grimly . The rats were being flushed out of their holes. It would \\nbe his pleasure to take care  of this renegade Sicilian. \\n“Do you know what I am going to ask of you?” Sollozzo asked. \\nLuca shook his head. \\n“There’s big business to be made,” Sollozzo said . “I mean millions for everybody at the \\ntop level. On the first shipment I can guar antee you fifty thousand dollars. I’m talking \\nabout drugs. It’s the coming thing.” \\nLuca said, “Why come to me? You want me to talk to my Don?” \\nSollozzo grimaced. “I’ve already  talked to the Don. He wants no part of it. All right, I can \\ndo without him. But I need somebody strong to protect the operation physically. I \\nunderstand you’re not happy with your Family, you might make a switch.” \\nLuca shrugged. “If the offer is good enough.” \\nSollozzo had been watching him in tently and seemed to have come to a decision. “Think \\nabout my offer for a few days and  then we’ll talk ag ain,” he said. He put out his hand but \\nLuca pretended not to see it and busied himself putting a cigarette in his mouth. Behind \\nthe bar, Bruno Tattaglia made a lighter appear magically and hel d it to Luca’s cigarette. \\nAnd then he did a strange thing. He dr opped the lighter on t he bar and grabbed Lucas \\nright hand, holding it tight. \\nLuca reacted instantly, his body slipping off t he bar stool and trying to twist away. But \\nSollozzo had grabbed hi s other hand at the wris t. Still, Luca was too strong for both of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 92\\nthem and would have broken free except that  a man stepped out of the shadows behind \\nhim and threw a thin silken cord around his neck. The cord pulled tight, choking off \\nLucas breath. His face became purple, the st rength in his arms drained away. Tattaglia \\nand Sollozzo held his hands easily  now, and they stoo d there curiously childlike as the \\nman behind Luca pulled the cord around Luca s neck tighter and ti ghter. Suddenly the \\nfloor was wet and slippery. Luca’s sphincter, no longer under control, opened, the waste \\nof his body spilled out. There was no strength  in him anymore and his legs folded, his \\nbody sagged. Sollozzo and Tattaglia let his hands go and only the strangler stayed with \\nthe victim, sinking to his knees to follow Lucas falling body, drawin g the cord so tight \\nthat it cut into the flesh of the neck and disappeared. Lucas eyes were bulging out of his \\nhead as if in the utmost surprise and this su rprise was the only humanity remaining to \\nhim. He was dead. \\n“I don’t want him found,” Sollozzo said. “ It’s important that he not be found right now.” \\nHe turned on his heel and left, disappearing back into the shadows. \\nChapter 8   \\nThe day after the shooting of  Don Corleone was a busy time for the Family. Michael \\nstayed by the phone relaying messages to Sonny . Tom Hagen was busy trying to find a \\nmediator satisfactory to both parties so  that a conference co uld be arranged with \\nSollozzo. The Turk had suddenly become c agey, perhaps he knew that the Family \\nbutton men of Clemenza and Tessio were ranging far and wide over  the city in an \\nattempt to pick up his trail. But Sollozzo was sticking clos e to his hideout, as were all top \\nmembers of the Tattaglia Family. This was expected by Sonny, an elementary \\nprecaution he knew the enemy was bound to take. \\nClemenza was tied up with Paulie Gatto . Tessio had been given the assignment of \\ntrying to track down the whereabouts of Luca Brasi. Luca had not been home since the \\nnight before the shooting, a bad sign. But Sonny  could not believe that Brasi had either \\nturned traitor or had been taken by surprise. \\nMama Corleone was staying in the city with fr iends of the Family so that she could be \\nnear the hospital. Carlo Rizzi, the son-in-l aw, had offered his services but had been told \\nto take care of his own business that D on Corleone had set him up in, a lucrative \\nbookmaking territory in the Italian section of Manhattan. Connie was staying with her \\nmother in town so that she too coul d visit her father in the hospital. \\nFreddie was still under sedati on in his own room of his parents’ house. Sonny and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 93\\nMichael had paid him a visit and had been as tonished at his paleness, his obvious \\nillness. “Christ,” Sonny said to Michael wh en they left Freddie’s room, “he looks like he \\ngot plugged worse than the old man.” \\nMichael shrugged. He had seen sold iers in the same condition on the battlefield. But he \\nhad never expected it to happen to Freddie . He remembered the middle brother as \\nbeing physically the toughest one in the family when all of them we re kids. But he had \\nalso been the most obedient so n to his father. And yet everyone knew that the Don had \\ngiven up on this middle son ev er being important to  the business. He wasn’t quite smart \\nenough, and failing that, not quite ruthless enough. He was too retiring a person, did not \\nhave enough force. \\nLate in the afternoon, Michael got a call from Johnny Fontane in Hollywood. Sonny took \\nthe phone. “Nah, Johnny, no use coming back her e to see the old man. He’s too sick \\nand it would give you a lot of bad publicity,  and I know the old man wouldn’t like that. \\nWait until he’s better and we can move him hom e, then come see him.  OK, I’ll give him \\nyour regards.” Sonny hung up the phone. He turned to Michae l and said. “That’ll make \\nPop happy, that Johnny wanted to fly from California to see how he was.” \\nLate that afternoon, Michael was called to the listed phone in the kitchen by one of \\nClemenza’s men. It was Kay. \\n“Is your father all right?” she asked. Her voice was a little strained, a little unnatural. \\nMichael knew that she couldn ’t quite believe what had happe ned, that his father really \\nwas what the newspapers called a gangster. \\n“He’ll be OK,” Michael said. \\n“Can I come with you when you visit him in the hospital?” Kay asked. \\nMichael laughed. She had remembered him tellin g her how important it was to do such \\nthings if you wanted to get along  with the old Italians. “This is a special case,” he said. “If \\nthe newspaper guys get ahold of your name and background you’ll be on page three of the Daily News. Girl from old Yankee family mixed up with son of big Mafia chief. How \\nwould your parents like that?” \\nKay said dryly, “My parents never read the Daily News.” Again there was an awkward \\npause and then she said, “You’re OK, aren’t y ou, Mike, you’re not in any danger?” \\nMike laughed again. “I’m known as the sissy of  the Corleone family. No threat. So they \\ndon’t have to bother coming after me. No, it’s  all over, Kay, there won’t be any more  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 94\\ntrouble. It was all sort of an accident  anyway. I’ll explain when I see you.” \\n“When will that be?” she asked. \\nMichael pondered. “How about late tonight? We ’ll have a drink and supper in your hotel \\nand then I’ll go to the hospi tal and see my old man. I’m getting tired of hanging around \\nhere answering phones. OK? But don’t tell anybody. I don’t want newspaper \\nphotographers snapping pictures of us together. No kidd ing, Kay, it’s damned \\nembarrassing, especially for your parents.” \\n“All right,” Kay said. “I’ll be waiting. C an I do any Christmas shopping for you? Or \\nanything else?” \\n“No,” Michael said. “Just be ready.” \\nShe gave a little excited laugh. “I’ll be ready,” she said. “Aren’t I always?” \\n“Yes, you are,” he said. “That’s why you’re my best girl.” \\n“I love you,” she said. “Can you say it?” \\nMichael looked at the four hood sitting in the kitchen. “No,” he said. “Tonight, OK?” \\n“OK,” she said. He hung up. \\nClemenza had finally come back from his day’s work and was bustling around the \\nkitchen cooking up a huge pot of tomato sauc e. Michael nodded to him and went to the \\ncorner office where he found Hagen and Sonny waiting for him impatiently. “Is Clemenza out there?”  Sonny asked. \\nMichael grinned. “He’s cooking up spaghetti  for the troops, just like the army.” \\nSonny said impatiently, “Tell him to cut out th at crap and come on in here. I have more \\nimportant things for him to do. Get Tessio in here with him.” \\nIn a few minutes they were all gathered in the office. Sonny said curtly to Clemenza, \\n“You take care of him?” \\nClemenza nodded. “You won’t see him anymore.” \\nWith a slight electric shock, Michael realiz ed they were talking about Paulie Gatto and \\nthat little Paulie was dead, murdered by  that jolly wedding dancer, Clemenza. \\nSonny asked Hagen, “You have any luck with Sollozzo?” \\nHagen shook his head. “He seems to have cooled off on the negotiation idea. Anyway he doesn’t seem to be too anxious. Or maybe he’s just being very careful so that our  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 95\\nbutton men won’t nail him. Anyway I haven’t been able to set up a top-notch go-between \\nhe’ll trust. But he must know he has to negotiate now. He missed his chance when he \\nlet the old man get away from him.” \\nSonny said, “He’s a smart guy, the smartest our Family ever came up against. Maybe he figured we’re just stalling unt il the old man gets better or we can get a line on him.” \\nHagen shrugged. “Sure, he figures that. But he still has to negotiate. He has no choice. I’ll get it set up tomorrow. That’s certain.” \\nOne of Clemenza’s men knocked on the office door and then came in. He said to Clemenza, “It just came over the radio, the cops found Paulie Gatto. Dead in his car.” \\nClemenza nodded and said to the man, “Don’t worry about i t.” The button man gave his \\ncaporegime an astonished look, which was follow ed by a look of comprehension, before \\nhe went back to the kitchen. \\nThe conference went on as if there had been no interruption. Sonny asked Hagen, “Any \\nchange in the Don’s condition?” \\nHagen shook his head. “He’s OK but he won’t be able to talk for another couple of days. \\nHe’s all knocked out. Still recovering from the operation. Your mother spends most of the day with him, Connie too. There’s cops  all over the hospital and Tessio’s men hang \\naround too, just in case. In a couple of days he’ll be all right and then we can see what \\nhe wants us to do. Meanwhi le we have to keep Sollozzo from doing anything rash. \\nThat’s why I want to star t you talking deals with him.” \\nSonny grunted. “Until he does, I’ve got Cl emenza and Tessio looking for him. Maybe \\nwe’ll get lucky and solve the whole business.” \\n“You won’t get lucky,” Hagen said. “Sollozzo is too smart.” Hagen paused. “He knows \\nonce he comes to the table he’ll have to go our  way mostly. That’s why he’s stalling. I’m \\nguessing he’s trying to line up support from t he other New York Fam ilies so that we \\nwon’t go after him when the old man gives us the word.” \\nSonny frowned. “Why the hell should they do that?” \\nHagen said patiently, “To avert a big war which hurts everybody and brings the papers \\nand government into the act. Also, Sollozzo will give them a piece of the action. And you \\nknow how much dough there is in drugs. The Corleone Family doesn’t need it, we have \\nthe gambling, which is the best business to  have. But the other  Families are hungry. \\nSollozzo is a proven man, t hey know he can make the operat ion go on a big scale. Alive  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 96\\nhe’s money in their pockets, dead he’s trouble.” \\nSonny’s face was as Michael  had never seen it. The hea vy Cupid mouth and bronzed \\nskin seemed gray. “I don’t give a fuck what they  want. They better not mess in this fight.” \\nClemenza and Tessio shifted uneasily in their chairs, infantry leaders who hear their \\ngeneral rave about storming an impregnable hill  no matter what the cost. Hagen said a \\nlittle impatiently, “Come on, Sonny, your fat her wouldn’t like you thinking that way. You \\nknow what he always says, ‘That’s a waste.’ Sure, we’re not going to let anybody stop \\nus if the old man says we go after Sollozzo. But this is not a personal thing, this is \\nbusiness. If we go after the Turk and the Fa milies interfere, we’ll negotiate the issue. If \\nthe Families see that we’re determined to have Sollozzo, they’ll let us. The Don will \\nmake concessions in other areas to square things. But don’t go blood crazy on a thing like this. It’s business. Even the shooting of your father was busin ess, not personal. You \\nshould know that by now.” \\nSonny’s eyes were still hard.  “OK. I understand all that. Just  so long as you understand \\nthat nobody stands in our way when we want Sollozzo.” \\nSonny turned to Tessio. “Any leads on Luca?” \\nTessio shook his head. “None at all. Sollozzo must have snatched him.” \\nHagen said quietly, “Sollozzo wasn’t worried about Luca, which struck me as funny. He’s too smart not to worry about a guy like Luca. I think he maybe got him out of the \\npicture, one way or the other.” \\nSonny muttered, “Christ, I hope Luca isn’t figh ting against us. That’s the one thing I’d be \\nafraid of. Clemenza, Tessio, how do you two guys figure it?” \\nClemenza said slowly, “Anybody  could go wrong, look at P aulie. But with Luca, he was \\na man who could only go one way. The Godfather was the only thing he believed in, the \\nonly man he feared. But not only that, Sonny, he respected your father as no one else \\nrespected him and the Godfather has earned respect from everyone. No, Luca would \\nnever betray us. And I find it hard to belie ve that a man like Sollozzo, no matter how \\ncunning, could surprise Luca. He was a m an who suspected everyone and everything. \\nHe was always ready for the worst. I think maybe he just went off someplace for a few days. We’ll be hearing from him anytime now.” \\nSonny turned to Tessio. The Br ooklyn caporegime shrugged. “A ny man can turn traitor. \\nLuca was very touchy. Maybe the Don offended him some way. That could be. I think  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 97\\nthough that Sollozzo gave him a little surprise. That fits in with what the Consigliere \\nsays. We should expect the worst.” \\nSonny said to all of them, “Sollozzo shoul d get the word soon about Paulie Gatto. How \\nwill that affect him?” \\nClemenza said grimly, “It will make him think.  He will know the Corleone Family are not \\nfools. He will realize that he was very lucky yesterday.” \\nSonny said sharply, “That wasn’t luck. Sollozzo was planning that for weeks. They must \\nhave tailed the old man to his office ever y day and watched his routine. Then they \\nbought Paulie off and maybe Luca. They snat ched Tom right on the button. They did \\neverything they wanted to do. They were unlucky, not lucky. Those button men they \\nhired weren’t good enough  and the old man moved too quick.  If they had killed him, I \\nwould have had to make a deal and Sollozzo wo uld have won. For now. I would have \\nwaited maybe and got him five, ten years from now. But don’t call him lucky, Pete, that’s \\nunderrating him. And we’ve done that too much lately.” \\nOne of the button men brought a bowl of s paghetti in from the kitchen and then some \\nplates, forks and wine. They ate as they talked. Michael watched in amazement. He \\ndidn’t eat and neither did To m, but Sonny, Clemenza and Te ssio dug in, mopping up \\nsauce with crusts of bread. It was almost  comical. They continued their discussion. \\nTessio didn’t think that the lo ss of Paulie Gatto would upset  Sollozzo, in fact he thought \\nthat the Turk might have ant icipated it, indeed might have welcomed it. A useless mouth \\noff the payroll. And he would not be frightened by  it; after all, would they be in such a \\nsituation? \\nMichael spoke up diffidently. “I know I’m an amateur in this, but from everything you \\nguys have said about Sollozzo, plus the fact t hat all of a sudden he’s out of touch with \\nTom, I’d guess he has an ace up his sleeve. He might be ready to pull off something \\nreal tricky that would put him back on top. If we could figure out what that would be, \\nwe’d be in the driver’s seat.” \\nSonny said reluctantly, “Yeah, I thought of t hat and the only thing I can figure is Luca. \\nThe word is already out that he’s to be br ought here before he’s allo wed any of his old \\nrights in the Family. The only other thing I c an think of is that Sollozzo has made his \\ndeal with the Families in New York and we’ ll get the word tomorrow that they will be \\nagainst us in a war. That we’ll have to  give the Turk his deal. Right, Tom?” \\nHagen nodded. “That’s what it lo oks like to me. And we can’t move against that kind of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 98\\nopposition without your father. He’s the only one who can stand against the Families. He \\nhas the political connections they always n eed and he can use them for trading. If he \\nwants to badly enough.” \\nClemenza said, a little arrogantly for a man whose top button man had recently betrayed \\nhim, “Sollozzo will never get near this house, Boss, you don’t have to worry about that.” \\nSonny looked at him thoughtfully for a moment. Then he said to Tessio, “How about the \\nhospital, your men got it covered?” \\nFor the first time during the conference Tessio seemed to be absolutely sure of his ground. “Outside and inside,” he said. “Right ar ound the clock. The cops have it covered \\npretty good too. Detectives at the bedroom door waiting to q uestion the old man. That’s \\na laugh. The Don is still getting that stuff in the tubes, no food, so we don’t have to worry \\nabout the kitchen, which would be something to worry about with those Turks, they \\nbelieve in poison. They can’t get  at the Don, not in any way.” \\nSonny tilted back in his chair.  “It wouldn’t be me, they have  to do business with me, they \\nneed the Family machine.” He gr inned at Michael. “I wonder if  it’s you? Maybe Sollozzo \\nfigures to snatch you and hold you for a hostage to make a deal.” \\nMichael thought ruefully, there g oes my date with Kay. Sonny wouldn’t let him out of the \\nhouse. But Hagen said impatiently, “No, he could have snatched Mike anytime if he \\nwanted insurance. But everybody knows that Mi ke is not in the Family business. He’s a \\ncivilian and if Sollozzo snatches him, then he loses all the other New York Families. \\nEven the Tattaglias would hav e to help hunt him down. No, it’s simple enough. \\nTomorrow we’ll get a representat ive from all the Families who’ll tell us we have to do \\nbusiness with the Turk. That’s what he’s wa iting for. That’s his ace in the hole.” \\nMichael heaved a sigh of re lief. “Good,” he said. “I have to  go into town tonight.” \\n“Why?” Sonny asked sharply. \\nMichael grinned. “I figure I’ll drop in to the hospital and visit the old man, see Mom and \\nConnie. And I got some other th ings to do.” Like the Don, Michael never told his real \\nbusiness and now he didn’t w ant to tell Sonny he was seei ng Kay Adams. There was no \\nreason not to tell him, it was just habit. \\nThere was a loud murmur of voices in the kitchen. Clemenza went out to see what was \\nhappening. When he came back he was holding Luca Brasi’s bulletproof vest in his \\nhands. Wrapped in the vest was a huge dead fish.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 99\\nClemenza said dryly, “The Turk has heard about his spy Paulie Gatto.” \\nTessio said just as dryly, “And now we know about Luca Brasi.” \\nSonny lit a cigar and took a shot of whiske y. Michael, bewildered, said. “What the hell \\ndoes that fish mean?” It was Hagen the Iris her, the Consigliere, who answered him. \\n“The fish means that Luca Brasi is sleeping on the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “It’s an \\nold Sicilian message.” \\nChapter 9  \\nWhen Michael Corleone went into the city t hat night it was with a depressed spirit. He \\nfelt that he was being enmeshed in the Fam ily business against his will and he resented \\nSonny using him even to answer the phone. He felt uncomfortable being on the inside of \\nthe Family councils as if he could be absolu tely trusted with such secrets as murder. \\nAnd now, going to see Kay, he felt guilty about her also. He had never been completely \\nhonest with her about his family. He had told her about them but always with little jokes \\nand colorful anecdotes that made them seem  more like adventurers in a Technicolor \\nmovie than what they really were. And now  his father had been shot  down in the street \\nand his eldest brother was making plans for murder. That was putting it plainly and \\nsimply but that was never how he would tell it  to Kay. He had already said his father \\nbeing shot was more like an “accident” and that all the tro uble was over. Hell, it looked \\nlike it was just beginning. So nny and Tom were off-center on this guy Sollozzo, they \\nwere still underrating him, even though Sonny was smart enough to see the danger. \\nMichael tried to think what the Turk might have up his sleeve. He was obviously a bold \\nman, a clever man, a man of extraordinary force. You had to figure him to come up with \\na real surprise. But then Sonny and Tom and Clemenza and Tessio were all agreed that \\neverything was under control and they all had more experience than he did. He was the \\n“civilian” in this war, Michael  thought wryly. And they’d have to give him a hell of a lot \\nbetter medals than he’d gotten in World War II to make him join this one. \\nThinking this made him feel guilty about not feeling more sympathy for his father. His \\nown father shot fall of holes and yet in a curious way Michael, better than anyone else, \\nunderstood when Tom had said it was just business, not perso nal. That his father had \\npaid for the power he had wielded all his life,  the respect he had extorted from all those \\naround him. \\nWhat Michael wanted was out, out  of all this, to lead his own life. But he couldn’t cut \\nloose from the family until the crisis was over . He had to help in a civilian capacity. With  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 100\\nsudden clarity he realized that he  was annoyed with the role assi gned to him, that of the \\nprivileged noncombatant, the excu sed conscientious objector.  That was why the word \\n“civilian” kept popping into his sku ll in such an irritating way. \\nWhen he got to the hotel, Kay was waiting for him in the lobby. (A couple of Clemenza’s \\npeople had driven him into town and dropped hi m off on a nearby corner after making \\nsure they were not followed.) \\nThey had dinner together and so me drinks. “What time are you going to visit your \\nfather?” Kay asked. \\nMichael looked at his watch. “Visiting hour s end at eight-thirty. I think I’ll go after \\neverybody has left. They’ll let me up. He has a private room and his own nurses so I can \\njust sit with him for a while. I don’t think he c an talk yet or even know if I’m there. But I \\nhave to show respect.” \\nKay said quietly, “I feel so sorry for your  father, he seemed like such a nice man at the \\nwedding. I can’t believe the th ings the papers are printing a bout him. I’m sure most of \\nit’s not true.” \\nMichael said politely, “I don’ t think so either.” He was surprised to find himself so \\nsecretive with Kay. He love d her, he trusted her, but he would never tell her anything \\nabout his father or the Fa mily. She was an outsider. \\n“What about you?” Kay asked. “Are you going to get mixed up in this gang war the \\npapers are talking about so gleefully?” \\nMichael grinned, unbuttoned his jacket and held it wide open. “Look, no guns,” he said. \\nKay laughed. \\nIt was getting late and they went up to their room. She mixed a drink for both of them \\nand sat on his lap as they drank. Beneath her dress she was all silk until his hand \\ntouched the glowing skin of her thigh. They  fell back on the bed toget her and made love \\nwith all their clothes on, their mouths glued together. When they were finished they lay \\nvery still, feeling the heat of  their bodies burning through t heir garments. Kay murmured, \\n“Is that what you soldiers call a quickie?” \\n“Yeah,” Michael said. \\n“It’s not bad,” Kay said in a judicious voice. \\nThey dozed off until Michael suddenly started up anxiously and looked at his watch. \\n“Damn,” he said. “It’s nearly ten. I have to get down to the hospital.” He went to the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 101\\nbathroom to wash up and comb his hair. Kay came in afte r him and put her arms around \\nhis waist from behind. “When are we going to get married?” she asked. \\n“Whenever you say,” Michael said. “As soon as this family thing quiets down and my old \\nman gets better. I think you’d better ex plain things to your parents though.” \\n“What should I explain?” Kay said quietly. \\nMichael ran the comb through his hair. “Just say that you’ve met a brave, handsome guy \\nof Italian descent. Top marks at Dartmouth. Distinguished Se rvice Cross during the war \\nplus the Purple Heart. Honest. Hard-working. But his father is a Mafia chief who has to \\nkill bad people, sometimes bribe high government  officials and in his line of work gets \\nshot full of holes himself. But that has noth ing to do with his honest  hardworking son. Do \\nyou think you can remember all that?” \\nKay let go his body and leaned against the door of the bathroom. “Is he really?” she \\nsaid. “Does he really?” She paused. “Kill people?” \\nMichael finished combing his hair. “I don’t re ally know,” he said. “Nobody really knows. \\nBut I wouldn’t be surprised.” \\nBefore he went out the door she asked, “When will I see you again?” \\nMichael kissed her. “I want you to go home and think things over in that little hick town \\nof yours,” he said. “I don’t want you to get mixed up in this business in any way. After \\nthe Christmas holidays I’ll be back at school and we’ll get together up in Hanover. OK?” \\n“OK,” she said. She watched him go out the door, saw him wave before he stepped into the elevator. She had never felt so close to him, never so much in love and if someone \\nhad told her she would not se e Michael again until three years passed, she would not \\nhave been able to bear the anguish of it. \\n* * *  \\nWhen Michael got out of the cab in front of the French Hospit al he was surprised to see \\nthat the street was comple tely deserted. W hen he entered the ho spital he was even \\nmore surprised to find the lobby empty. Damn it, what the hell were Clemenza and Tessio doing? Sure, they never went to West Point but they knew enough about tactic to \\nhave outposts. A couple of  their men should have been in the lobby at least. \\nEven the latest visitors had depart ed, it was almost ten-thirty at night. Michael was tense \\nand alert now. He didn’t bother to stop at  the information desk, he already knew his \\nfather’s room number up on the fourth floor. He took the self-service elevator. Oddly  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 102\\nenough nobody stopped him until he r eached the nurses’ station on the fourth floor. But \\nhe strode right past her query and on to his fat her’s room. There was no one outside the \\ndoor. Where the hell were the two detective s who were supposed to be waiting around \\nto guard and question the old man? Where t he hell were Tessio and Clemenza’s \\npeople? Could there be someo ne inside the room? But the door was open. Michael \\nwent in. There was a figure in the bed and by the December moonlight straining through \\nthe window Michael could see his father’s face. Even now it was impassive, the chest \\nheaved shallowly with his uneven  breath. Tubes hung from st eel gallows beside the bed \\nand ran into his nose. On the floor was a gl ass jar receiving the poisons emptied from \\nhis stomach by other tubes. Michael stayed there for a few moments to make sure his \\nfather was all right, then backed out of the room. \\nHe told the nurse, “My name is Michael Corleone, I just want to sit with my father. What \\nhappened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding him?” \\nThe nurse was a pretty young thing with a great deal of c onfidence in the power of her \\noffice. “Oh, your father just had too many visi tors, it interfered with the hospital service,” \\nshe said. “The police came and made them al l leave about ten minutes ago. And then \\njust five minutes ago I had to call the det ectives to the phone for an emergency alarm \\nfrom their headquarters, and then t hey left too. But don’t worry, I look in on your father \\noften and I can hear any sound from his room . That’s why we leave the doors open.” \\n“Thank you,” Michael said. “I’ll sit with him for a little while. OK?” \\nShe smiled at him. “Just for a little bit and then I’m afraid you’ll have to leave. It’s the \\nrules, you know.” \\nMichael went back into his father’s room. He took the phone from its cradle and got the \\nhospital operator to give him the house in Long Beach, the phone in the corner office \\nroom. Sonny answered. Michael whispered, “Sonny, I’m down at the hospital, I came \\ndown late. Sonny, there’s nobody here. None of Tessio’s people. No detectives at the \\ndoor. The old man was completely unprot ected.” His voice was trembling. \\nThere was a long silence and then Sonny’s vo ice came, low and impressed, “This is \\nSollozzo’s move you were talking about.” \\nMichael said, “That’s what I figured too. But how did he get the cops to clear everybody \\nout and where did they go? W hat happened to Tessio’s men? Jesus Christ, has that \\nbastard Sollozzo got the New York Police Department in his pocket too?” \\n“Take it easy, kid.” Sonny’s voice was soothing. “We got lucky again with you going to  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 103\\nvisit the hospital so late. Stay in the old m an’s room. Lock the door from the inside. I’ll \\nhave some men there inside of fifteen minutes, soon as I make some calls. Just sit tight \\nand don’t panic. OK, kid?” \\n“I won’t panic,” Michael said. For the first ti me since it had all star ted he felt a furious \\nanger rising in him, a cold hat red for his father’s enemies. \\nHe hung up the phone and rang the buzzer for the nurse. He decided to use his own \\njudgment and disregard Sonny’s orders. When the nurse came in he said, “I don’t want \\nyou to get frightened, but we have to move my father right away. To another room or \\nanother floor. Can you disconnect all these tubes so we can wheel the bed out?” \\nThe nurse said, “That’s ridiculous. We have to get permission from the doctor.” \\nMichael spoke very quickly. “You’ve read about  my father in the papers. You’ve seen \\nthat there’s no one here tonight  to guard him. Now I’ve just  gotten word some men will \\ncome into the hospital to kill him. Please believe me and help me.” He-could be \\nextraordinarily persuasive when he wanted to be. \\nThe nurse said, “We don’t have to disconnec t the tubes. We can wheel the stand with \\nthe bed.” \\n“Do you have an empty room ?” Michael whispered. \\n“At the end of the ha ll,” the nurse said. \\nIt was done in a matter of moments, very quickl y and very efficiently. Then Michael said \\nto the nurse, “Stay here with him until help comes. If you’re  outside at your station you \\nmight get hurt.” \\nAt that moment he heard his father’s voice from the bed, hoarse but full of strength, \\n“Michael, is it you? What happened, what is it?” \\nMichael leaned over the bed. He took his fat her’s hand in his. “It’s Mike,” he said. “Don’t \\nbe afraid. Now listen, don’t make  any noise at all, especially  if somebody calls out your \\nname. Some people want to kill you, underst and? But I’m here so don’t be afraid.” \\nDon Corleone, still not fully conscious of what had happened to him the day before, in \\nterrible pain, yet smiled benevolently on his younges t son, wanting to tell him, but it was \\ntoo much effort, “Why should I be afraid now? Strange men have come  to kill me ever \\nsince I was twelve years old.” \\n  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 104\\nChapter 10  \\nThe hospital was small and private with just  one entrance. Michael looked through the \\nwindow down into the street. There was a cu rved courtyard that had steps leading down \\ninto the street and the street  was empty of cars. But whoever came into the hospital \\nwould have to come through that entrance. He knew he didn’t have much time so he ran \\nout of the room and down the four flights and through the wide d oors of the ground floor \\nentrance. Off to the side he saw the ambulance yard and t here was no car there, no \\nambulances either. \\nMichael stood on the sidewalk out side the hospital and lit a cigarette. He unbuttoned his \\ncoat and stood in the light of a lamppost so that his features could be seen. A young \\nman was walking swiftly down from Ninth Avenue, a package under his arm. The young \\nman wore a combat jacket and had a heavy sho ck of black hair. His face was familiar \\nwhen he came under the lamplight but Michael  could not place it. But the young man \\nstopped in front of him and put out his hand, saying in a heavy Italian accent, “Don \\nMichael, do you remember me? Enzo, the baker ’s helper to Nazorine the Paniterra; his \\nson-in-law. Your father saved my life by getting the government to let me stay in \\nAmerica.” \\nMichael shook his hand. He remembered him now. \\nEnzo went on, “I’ve come to pay my respects to your father. Will they let me into the \\nhospital so late?” \\nMichael smiled and shook his head. “No, but thanks anyway. I’ll tell the Don you came.” \\nA car came roaring down the street and Mic hael was instantly alert. He said to Enzo, \\n“Leave here quickly. There may be trouble. You don’t want to get involved with the \\npolice.” \\nHe saw the look of fear on the young Italia n’s face. Trouble with the police might mean \\nbeing deported or refusal of citizenship. But the young man stood fast. He whispered in \\nItalian. “If there’s trouble I’ll stay to  help. I owe it to  the Godfather.” \\nMichael was touched. He was ab out to tell the young man to go away again, but then he \\nthought, why not let him stay? Two men in front of the hospital might scare off any of \\nSollozzo’s crew sent to do a job. One man almost certai nly would not. He gave Enzo a \\ncigarette and lit it for him. They both st ood under the lamppost is the cold December \\nnight. The yellow panes of the hospital, bisected by the gr eens of Christmas \\ndecorations, twinkled down on them. They had almost finished their cigarettes when a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 105\\nlong low black car turned into 30th Street from Ninth Avenue and cruised toward them, \\nvery close to the curb. It almost stopped. Michael peered to see their faces inside, his \\nbody flinching involuntarily. The car s eemed about to stop, then speeded forward. \\nSomebody had recognized him. Michael gave Enzo another cigarette and noticed that \\nthe baker’s hands were shaking. To his surprise his own hands were steady. \\nThey stayed in the street smoking for what was no more than ten minutes when \\nsuddenly the night air was spli t by a police siren. A patrol car made a screaming turn \\nfrom Ninth Avenue and pulled up in front of the hospital. Two more squad cars followed \\nright behind it. Suddenly the hospital ent ranceway was flooded wit h uniformed police \\nand detectives. Michael heaved a sigh of relief. Good old Sonny must have gotten \\nthrough right away. He moved forward to meet them. \\nTwo huge, burly policemen grabbed his arms. A nother frisked him. A massive police \\ncaptain, gold braid on his cap,  came up the steps, his men parting respectfully to leave a \\npath. He was a vigorous man for his girth a nd despite the white hair that peeked out of \\nhis cap. His face was beefy red. He came up to Michael and said  harshly, “I thought I \\ngot all you guinea hoods locked up. Who t he hell are you and what  are you doing here?” \\nOne of the cops standing beside Mic hael said, “He’s clean, Captain.” \\nMichael didn’t answer. He was studying this police captain, coldly searching his face, \\nthe metallic blue eyes. A detective in plain clothes said, “That’s Michael Corleone, the \\nDon’s son.” \\nMichael said quietly, “What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be \\nguarding my father? Who pull ed them off that detail?” \\nThe police captain was choleric  with rage. “You fucking hood, who the hell are you to tell \\nme my business? I pulled them off. I don’t give a shit how many dago gangsters kill \\neach other. If it was up to me , I wouldn’t lift a finger to keep  your old man from getting \\nknocked off. Now get the hell out of here. Get out of this street, you punk, and stay out \\nof this hospital when it’s not visiting hours.” \\nMichael was still studying him intently. He wa s not angry at what this police captain was \\nsaying. His mind was racing furiously. Was it possible that Sollozzo had been in that first \\ncar and had seen him standing in front of the hospital? Was it possible that Sollozzo had then called this captain and  said, “How come the Corleones’ men are still around the \\nhospital when I paid you to lo ck them up?” Was it possible that all had been carefully \\nplanned as Sonny had sai d? Everything fitted in. Still cool, he said to the captain, “I’m  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 106\\nnot leaving this hospital until you pu t guards around my father’s room.” \\nThe captain didn’t bother answering. He said to the detective standing  beside him, “Phil, \\nlock this punk up.” \\nThe detective said hesitantly, “The kid is clean, Captain. He’s a war hero and he’s never \\nbeen mixed up in the rackets. The papers could make a stink.” \\nThe captain started to turn on the detective, his face red with fury. He roared out, \\n“Goddamn it, I said lock him up.” \\nMichael, still thinking clearly, not angry, said  with deliberate malice, “How much is the \\nTurk paying you to set my  father up, Captain?” \\nThe police captain turned to him. He said to the two burly patrolmen, “Hold him.” Michael felt his arms pinned to his sides. He saw the captain’s massive fist arching \\ntoward his face. He tried to weave away but the fist caught him high on the cheekbone. \\nA grenade exploded in his skull. His mouth filled with blood and sm all hard bones that \\nhe realized were his teeth. He could feel the side of his head puff up as  if it were filling \\nwith air. His legs were we ightless and he would have fall en if the two policemen had not \\nheld him up. But he was still conscious. The plainclothes detective had stepped in front \\nof him to keep the captain from hitting him again and was saying, “Jesus Christ, \\nCaptain, you really hurt him.” \\nThe captain said loudly, “I didn’t touch him. He attacked me and he fell. Do you \\nunderstand that? He resisted arrest.” \\nThrough a red haze Michael could see more cars pulling up to the curb. Men were getting out. One of them he re cognized as Clemenza’s lawy er, who was now speaking \\nto the police captain, suavely and surely . “The Corleone Family has hired a firm of \\nprivate detectives to guard Mr. Corleone. These men wit h me are licensed to carry \\nfirearms, Captain. If you arre st them, you’ll have to appear before a judge in the morning \\nand tell him why.” \\nThe lawyer glanced at Michael. “Do you want to prefer charges against whoever did this \\nto you?” he asked. \\nMichael had trouble talking. His jaws wouldn’t come together  but he managed to \\nmumble. “I slipped,” he said. “I slipped a nd fell.” He saw the captain give him a \\ntriumphant glance and he tried to answer that glance with a smile. At all costs he wanted \\nto hide the delicious icy chillin ess that controlled his brain,  the surge of wintry cold  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 107\\nhatred that pervaded his body. He wanted to give no warning to anyone in this world as \\nto how he felt at this moment. As the Don would not. Then he felt himself carried into the \\nhospital and he lost consciousness. \\nWhen he woke up in the morning he found that his jaw had been wired together and that \\nfour of his teeth along the le ft side of his mouth were missing. Hagen was sitting beside \\nhis bed. \\n“Did they drug me up?” Michael asked. \\n“Yeah,” Hagen said. “They had to dig some bone fragments out of your gums and they \\nfigured it would be too painful. Besides you were practically out anyway.” \\n“Is there anything else wrong with me?” Michael asked. \\n“No,” Hagen said. “Sonny wants you out at  the Long Beach house. Think you can make \\nit?” \\n“Sure,” Michael said. “Is the Don all right?” \\nHagen flushed. “I think we’ve solved the problem now. We have a firm of private detectives and we have the whole area loaded. I’ll tell you more when we get in the car.” \\nClemenza was driving, Michael and Hagen sa t in the back. Michael’s head throbbed. \\n“So what the hell really happened last night, did you guys ever find out?” \\nHagen spoke quietly. “Sonny has an inside man, that Detective Phillips who tried to \\nprotect you. He gave us the scoop. The police captain, McCluskey, is a guy who’s been \\non the take very heavy ever since he’s been a patrolman. Our Family has paid him quite \\na bit. And he’s greedy and untrustworthy to do business with. But Sollozzo must have \\npaid him a big price. McCluskey had all Te ssio’s men around and in the hospital \\narrested right after visiting hours. It didn’t help that some of them were carrying guns. \\nThen McCluskey pulled the official guard detectives off the Don’s door. Claimed he \\nneeded them and that some other cops were supposed to go over and take their place \\nbut they got their assignments bollixed. Baloney. He was paid off to set the Don up. And \\nPhillips said he’s the kind of guy who’ll tr y it again. Sollozzo must have given him a \\nfortune for openers and promised him the moon to come.” \\n“Was my getting hurt in the papers?” \\n“No,” Hagen said. “We kept that quiet. Nobody wants that known. Not the cops. Not us.” \\n“Good,” Michael said. “Did t hat boy Enzo get away?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 108\\n“Yeah,” Hagen said. “He was smarter than y ou. When the cops came he disappeared. \\nHe claims he stuck with you while Sollo zzo’s car went by . Is that true?” \\n“Yeah,” Michael said. “He’s a good kid.” \\n“He’ll be taken care of,” Hagen said. “You f eeling OK?” His face was concerned. “You \\nlook lousy.” \\n“I’m OK,” Michael said. “What wa s that police captain’s name?” \\n“McCluskey,” Hagen said. “By the way, it might make you feel better to know that the \\nCorleone Family finally got up on the scoreboard. Bruno Ta ttaglia, four o’clock this \\nmorning.” \\nMichael sat up. “How come? I thought  we were supposed to sit tight.” \\nHagen shrugged. “After what happened at the hos pital Sonny got hard. The button men \\nare out all over Ne w York and New Jersey. We made the li st last night. I’m trying to hold \\nSonny in, Mike. Maybe you can talk to him. This whole business can still be settled \\nwithout a major war.” \\n“I’ll talk to him,” Michael said. “I s there a conference this morning?” \\n“Yeah,” Hagen said. “Sollozzo finally got in touch and wants to sit down with us. A negotiator is arranging the details. That means we win. Sollo zzo knows he’s lost and he \\nwants to get out with his life.” Hagen paused . “Maybe he thought we were soft, ready to \\nbe taken, because we didn’t st rike back. Now with one of the Tattaglia sons dead he \\nknows we mean business. He really took an awful gamble bucking the Don. By the way, \\nwe got the confirmation on Luca. They killed hi m the night before they  shot your father. \\nIn Bruno’s nightclub. Imagine that?” \\nMichael said, “No wonder t hey caught him off guard.” \\n* * *  \\nAt the houses in Long Beach the entrance to the mall was blocked by a long black car \\nparked across its mouth. Two men leaned against the hood of the car. The two houses \\non each side, Michael noticed, had opened windows on their upper floors. Christ, Sonny \\nmust really mean business. \\nClemenza parked the car outside the mall and they walked inside it. The two guards \\nwere Clemenza’s men and he gave them a frown of greeting that served as a salute. \\nThe men nodded their heads in acknowledgmen t. There were no smiles, no greetings.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 109\\nClemenza led Hagen and Michael Corleone into the house. \\nThe door was opened by another guard before they r ang. He had obviously been \\nwatching from a window. They went to the corner office and found Sonny and Tessio \\nwaiting for them. Sonny came to Michael, took his younger brother’s head in his hands \\nand said kiddingly, “Beautiful. Be autiful.” Michael knocked hi s hands away, and went to \\nthe desk and poured himself some scotch, hoping it would dull the ache in his wired jaw. \\nThe five of them sat around the room but t he atmosphere was differ ent from their earlier \\nmeetings. Sonny was gayer, more cheerful, and Michael realized what that gaiety \\nmeant. There were no longer any doubts in his older brother’s mind. He was committed \\nand nothing would sway him. The attempt by  Sollozzo the night before was the final \\nstraw. There could no longer be any question of a truce. \\n“We got a call from the negotiator while yo u were gone,” Sonny said to Hagen. “The \\nTurk wants a meeting now.” Sonny laughed. “T he balls on that son of a bitch,” he said \\nadmiringly. “After he craps out last night he wants a meeting today or the next day. Meanwhile we’re supposed just to lay back and take everything he dishes out. What \\nfucking nerve.” \\nTom asked cautiously, “What did you answer?” \\nSonny grinned. “I said sure, why not? Anyt ime he says, I’m in no hurry. I’ve got a \\nhundred button men out on the st reet twenty-four hours a day. If Sollozzo shows one \\nhair on his asshole he’s dead. Let them  take all the time they want.” \\nHagen said, “Was there a definite proposal?” \\n“Yeah,” Sonny said. “He wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The \\nnegotiator guarantees Mike’s safety. Sollozzo doesn’t ask us to guarantee his safety, he \\nknows he can’t ask that. No point. So the meeting will be arranged on his side. His \\npeople will pick Mike up and take  Mike to the meeting place. Mike will listen to Sollozzo \\nand then they’ll turn him loose. But the meeti ng place is secret. The promise is the deal \\nwill be so good we can’t turn it down.” \\nHagen asked, “What about the Tattag lias? What will they do about Bruno?” \\n“That’s part of the deal. The negotiator says t he Tattaglia Family has agreed to go along \\nwith Sollozzo. They’ll forget about Bruno Tattaglia. He pays for what they did to my father. One cancels out t he other.” Sonny laughed again. “The nervy bastards.” \\nHagen said cautiously, “We should hear what they have to say.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 110\\nSonny shook his head from side to side. “No, no, Consigliere, not this time.” His voice \\nheld a faint trace of Italian accent. He was consciously mocking his father just to kid \\naround. “No more meetings. No more discussi ons. No more Sollozzo tricks. When the \\nnegotiator gets in touch with us again for our answer I want you to give him one \\nmessage. I want Sollozzo. If not, it’s all-out war. We’ll go to the mattresses and we’ll put \\nall the button men out on the street. Business will just have to suffer.” \\n“The other Families won’t st and for an all-out war,” Hagen sa id. “It puts too much heat \\non everybody.” \\nSonny shrugged. “They have a simple solution. Give me Sollozzo. Or fight the Corleone \\nFamily.” Sonny paused, then said roughly, “No more advice on how to patch it up, Tom. The decision is made. Your job is to help me win. Understand?” \\nHagen bowed his head. He was deep in thought for a moment. Then he said, “I spoke to \\nyour contact in the police station. He sa ys that Captain McCluskey is definitely on \\nSollozzo’s payroll and for big money. Not only that, but McCluskey is going to get a \\npiece of the drug operation. McCluskey ha s agreed to be Sollozzo’s bodyguard. The \\nTurk doesn’t poke his nose out of his hole without McCluskey. When he meets Mike for \\nthe conference, McCluskey will be sitting beside him. In civilian clothes but carrying his gun. Now what you have to understand, S onny, is that while Sollozzo is guarded like \\nthis, he’s invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain and \\ngotten away with it. The heat in this town would be unbearable what with the \\nnewspapers, the whole police department, the churches, ev erything. That would be \\ndisastrous. The Families would be after you. The Corleone Family would become \\noutcasts. Even the old man’s political protecti on would run for cover. So take that into \\nconsideration.” \\nSonny shrugged. “McCluskey can’t stay wit h the Turk forever. We’ll wait.” \\nTessio and Clemenza were puffing on their cigars uneasily, not daring to speak, but \\nsweating. It would be their skins that woul d go on the line if the wrong decision was \\nmade. \\nMichael spoke for the first time. He asked Hagen, “Can the old man be moved out of the \\nhospital onto the mall here?” \\nHagen shook his head. “That’s the first thing I asked. Impossible. He’s in very bad \\nshape. He’ll pull through but he needs all kinds of attention, maybe some more surgery. \\nImpossible.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 111\\n“Then you have to get Sollozzo right away,” Mi chael said. “We can’t wait. The guy is too \\ndangerous. He’ll come up with some new idea. Re member, the key is still that he gets \\nrid of the old man. He knows that. OK, he know s that now it’s very tough so he’s willing \\nto take defeat for his life. But if he’s going to get killed anyway, he’ll have another crack \\nat the Don. And with that polite captain helping him who knows what the hell might \\nhappen. We can’t take that chance. We have to get Sollozzo right away.” \\nSonny was scratching his chin thoughtfully. “You’ re right, kid,” he said. “You got right to \\nthe old nuts. We can’t let Sollozzo get another crack at the old man.” \\nHagen said quietly, “What about Captain McCluskey?” \\nSonny turned to Michael with an odd little smile. “Yeah, kid, what about  that tough police \\ncaptain?” \\nMichael said slowly, “OK, it’s an extreme.  But there are times when the most extreme \\nmeasures are justified. Let’s think now that we have to ki ll McCluskey. The way to do it \\nwould be to have him heavily im plicated so that it’s no t an honest police captain doing \\nhis duty but a crooked police official mixed up in the racke ts who got what was coming \\nto him, like any crook. We have newspaper people on our payroll we c an give that story \\nto with enough proof so that  they can back it up. That shoul d take some of the heat off. \\nHow does that sound?” Mic hael looked around deferentially to the others. Tessio and \\nClemenza had gloomy faces and refused to s peak. Sonny said with the same odd smile, \\n“Go on, kid, you’re doing great. Out of the m ouths of infants, as the Don always used to \\nsay. Go ahead, Mike, tell us more.” \\nHagen was smiling too a little and averting his head. Michael flushed. “Well, they want \\nme to go to a conference with Sollozzo. It will be me, Sollozzo and McCluskey all on our \\nown. Set up the meeting for tw o days from now, then get our informers to find out where \\nthe meeting will be held. Insist that it has to be a public place, that I’m not going to let \\nthem take me into any apartments or houses. Let it be a restaurant or a bar at the height \\nof the dinner hour, something like that, so that  I’ll feel safe. They’ll feel safe too. Even \\nSollozzo won’t figure that we’ll dare to gun the captain. T hey’ll frisk me when I meet \\nthem so I’ll have to be clean then, but fi gure out a way you c an get a weapon to me \\nwhile I’m meeting them. Then I’ll take both of them.” \\nAll four heads turned and star ed at him. Clemenza and Tessi o were gravely astonished. \\nHagen looked a little sad but not surprised. He  started to speak and thought better of it. \\nBut Sonny, his heavy Cupid’s face twitching wit h mirth, suddenly brok e out in loud roars  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 112\\nof laughter. It was deep belly laughter, not fa king. He was really breaking up. He pointed \\na finger at Michael, trying to speak through gas ps of mirth. “You, the high-class college \\nkid, you never wanted to get mixed up in the Family business. Now you wanta kill a \\npolice captain and the Turk just because you got your face smashed by McCluskey. \\nYou’re taking it personal, it’s just busine ss and you’re taking it personal. You wanta kill \\nthese two guys just because you got slapped in the face. It was all a lot of crap. All \\nthese years it was just a lot of crap.” \\nClemenza and Tessio, completely misunderstandi ng, thinking that Sonny was laughing \\nat his young brother’s bravado for making such  an offer, were also smiling broadly and a \\nlittle patronizingly at Michael. Only H agen warily kept his face impassive. \\nMichael looked around at all of them, then stared at Sonny , who still couldn’t stop \\nlaughing. “You’ll take both of t hem?” Sonny said. “Hey, kid, they won’t give you medals, \\nthey put you in the electric c hair. You know that? This is no hero business, kid, you don’t \\nshoot people from a mile away. You shoot when you see the whites of their eyes like we \\ngot taught in school, remember? You gotta  stand right next to them and blow their \\nheads off and their brains get all over your nice Ivy League suit. How about that, kid, you wanta do that just because some dumb cop slapped you around?” He was still laughing. \\nMichael stood up. “You’d better stop laughing,” he said. The change in him was so \\nextraordinary that the smiles vanished from the faces of Clemenza and Tessio. Michael \\nwas not tall or heavily built but his presence seemed to radiate danger. In that moment he was a reincarnation of Don Corleone himself. His eyes had gone a pale tan and his \\nface was bleached of color. He seemed at any moment about  to fling himself on his \\nolder and stronger brother. T here was no doubt that if he had had a weapon in his \\nhands Sonny would have been in danger. Sonny stopped laughing, and Michael said to \\nhim in a cold deadly voice, “Don’t you th ink I can do it, you son of a bitch?” \\nSonny had got over his laughing fit. “I know you can do it,” he said. “I wasn’t laughing at \\nwhat you said. I was just laughing at how f unny things turn out. I always said you were \\nthe toughest one in the Family, tougher than t he Don himself. You were the only one \\nwho could stand off the old man.  I remember you when you we re a kid. What a temper \\nyou had then. Hell, you even used to fight me and I was a lot older than you. And \\nFreddie had to beat the shit out of you at least once a week. And now Sollozzo has you \\nfigured for the soft touch in the Family be cause you let McCluskey hit you without \\nfighting back and you wouldn’t get mixed up in  the Family fights. He figures he got \\nnothing to worry about if he m eets you head to head. And Mc Cluskey too, he’s got you  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 113\\nfigured for a yellow guinea.” Sonny paused and then said softly, “But you’re a Corleone \\nafter all, you son of a bitch. And I was t he only one who knew i t. I’ve been sitting here \\nwaiting for the last three days,  ever since the old man got shot, waiting for you to crack \\nout of that Ivy League, war her o bullshit character you’ve been wearing. I’ve been \\nwaiting for you to become my right arm so we can kill those fucks that are trying to \\ndestroy our father and our Fam ily. And all it took  was a sock on the jaw. How do you like \\nthat?” Sonny made a comical gesture, a punch, and repeated,  “How do you like that?” \\nThe tension had relaxed in the room. Mike s hook his head. “Sonny, I’m doing it because \\nit’s the only thing to do. I c an’t give Sollozzo another crack at  the old man. I seem to be \\nthe only one who can get clos e enough to him. And I figured it out. I don’t think you can \\nget anybody else to knock off a police captai n. Maybe you would do it, Sonny, but you \\nhave a wife and kids and you have to run t he Family business until the old man is in \\nshape. So that leaves me and Fr eddie. Freddie is in shock and out of action. Finally that \\nleaves just me. It’s all logic. The sock on the jaw had nothing to do with it.” \\nSonny came over and embraced him. “I don’t gi ve a damn what your reasons are, just \\nso long as you’re with us now. And I’ll tell you another thing, you’re right all the way. \\nTom, what’s your say?” \\nHagen shrugged. “The reasoning is solid. What makes it so is that I don’t think the Turk \\nis sincere about a deal. I think he’ll still try to get at the Don. Anyway on his past \\nperformance that’s how we have to figure him. So we try to get Sollozzo. We get him even if we have to get the police captain. Bu t whoever does the job is going to get an \\nawful lot of heat. Does it have to be Mike?” \\nSonny said softly, “I could do it.” \\nHagen shook his head impatiently. “Sollozzo woul dn’t let you get withi n a mile of him if \\nhe had ten police captains. And besides you’re  the acting head of the Family. You can’t \\nbe risked.” Hagen paused and said to Clemenza  and Tessio, “Do either  one of you have \\na top button man, someone really  special, who would take on this job? He wouldn’t have \\nto worry about money for the rest of his life.” \\nClemenza spoke first. “Nobody that Sollozzo wo uldn’t know, he’d ca tch on right away. \\nHe’d catch on if me or Tessio went too.” \\nHagen said, “What about somebody really tough who hasn’t made his rep yet, a good rookie?” \\nBoth caporegimes shook their heads. Tessio smiled to take the sting out of his words  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 114\\nand said, “That’s like bringing a guy up from  the minors to pitch the World Series.” \\nSonny broke in curtly, “It has to be Mike. Fo r a million different reasons. Most important \\nthey got him down as faggy. And he can do the job, I guarantee that, and that’s \\nimportant because this is the on ly shot we’ll get at  that sneaky bastard Turk. So now we \\nhave to figure out the best way to back him up. Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, find out where \\nSollozzo will take him for the conference, I don’t care how much it costs. When we find \\nthat out we can figure out how we can get a weapon into his hands. Clemenza, I want \\nyou to get him a really ‘safe’ gun out of your collection, the ‘coldest’ one you got. \\nImpossible to trace. Try to make it short barrel with a lot of blasting power. It doesn’t \\nhave to be accurate. He’ll be right on top of  them when he uses it. Mike, as soon as \\nyou’ve used the gun, drop it on the floor. Don’t be caught with it on you. Clemenza, tape \\nthe barrel and the trigger with that special stuff you got so he won’t leave prints. \\nRemember, Mike, we can square everything, wit nesses, and so forth, but if they catch \\nyou with the gun on you we can’t square that. We’ll have transportation and protection and then we’ll make you disap pear for a nice long vacation until the heat wears off. \\nYou’ll be gone a long time, Mike, but I don’t want  you saying good-bye to your girl friend \\nor even calling her. After it’s all over and you’re out of the country I’ll send her word that \\nyou’re OK. Those are orders.” Sonny smiled at his brother. “Now stick with Clemenza \\nand get used to handling the gun he picks out for y ou. Maybe even practice a little. We’ll \\ntake care of everything else. Everything. OK, kid?” \\nAgain Michael Corleone felt that  delicious refreshing chilliness all over his body. He said \\nto his brother, “You didn’t have to give me that crap about not talkin g to my girl friend \\nabout something like this. What the hell did y ou think I was going to  do, call her up to \\nsay good-bye?” \\nSonny said hastily, “OK, but you’re still a r ookie so I spell things out. Forget it.” \\nMichael said with a grin, “What the hell do y ou mean, a rookie? I listened to the old man \\njust as hard as you did. How do you thin k I got so smart?” They both laughed. \\nHagen poured drinks for everyone. He looked a little glum. The statesman forced to go \\nto war, the lawyer forced to go to law. “Well, anyway, now we know what we’re going to \\ndo,” he said. \\n \\n  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 115\\nChapter 11 \\nCaptain Mark McCluskey sat in his office  fingering three envelopes bulging with betting \\nslips. He was frowning and wishing he coul d decode the notations on the slips. It was \\nvery important that he do so . The envelopes were the betti ng slips that his raiding \\nparties had picked up when they had hit one of the Corleone Fam ily bookmakers the \\nnight before. Now the bookmaker would have to buy back the slips so that players \\ncouldn’t claim winners and wipe him out. \\nIt was very important for Captain McCluskey to  decode the slips because he didn’t want \\nto get cheated when he sold the slips back to the bookmaker. If there was fifty grand \\nworth of action, then maybe he could sell it back for five grand. But if there were a lot of \\nheavy bets and the slips represented a hundred grand or maybe even two hundred \\ngrand, then the price shoul d be considerably higher. McCluskey fiddled with the \\nenvelopes and then decided to let the bookie sweat  a little bit and make  the first offer. \\nThat might tip off what the real price should be. \\nMcCluskey looked at the station house clock on t he wall of his office. It was time for him \\nto pick up that greasy Turk, Sollozzo,and take him to wherever he was going to meet the \\nCorleone Family. McCluskey went over to his wall locker and start ed to change into his \\ncivilian clothes. When he was finished he calle d his wife and told her he would not be \\nhome for supper that night, that he would be out on the job. He nev er confided in his \\nwife on anything. She thought t hey lived the way they di d on his policeman’s salary. \\nMcCluskey grunted with amusement. His mother  had thought the same thing but he had \\nlearned early. His father had shown him the ropes. \\nHis father had been a police sergeant, and every week father and son had walked \\nthrough the precinct and McClu skey Senior had introduced his six-year-old son to the \\nstorekeepers, saying, “And this is my little boy.” \\nThe storekeepers would shake his hand and compliment him extravagantly and ring \\nopen their cash registers to give the little boy a gift of five or ten dollars. At the end of \\nthe day, little Mark McCluskey would have all t he pockets of his suit stuffed with paper \\nmoney, would feel so proud that  his father’s friends liked hi m well enough to give him a \\npresent every month they saw him. Of course his father put the money in the bank for \\nhim, for his college education, and little Mark got at most a fifty-c ent piece for himself. \\nThen when Mark got home and his policemen uncles asked hi m what he wanted to be \\nwhen he grew up and he would lisp childishly, “A policeman,” they would all laugh  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 116\\nuproariously. And of course later on, though his father wanted him to go to college first, \\nhe went right from high school to studying for the police force. \\nHe had been a good cop, a brave cop. The tough young punks terrorizing street corners \\nfled when he approached and finally vanished from  his beat altogether. He was a very \\ntough cop and a very fair one. He never t ook his son around to the storekeepers to \\ncollect his money presents for ignoring ga rbage violations and parking violations; he \\ntook the money directly into his own hand, di rect because he felt he earned it. He never \\nducked into a movie house or goofed off into restaurants when he was on foot patrol as \\nsome of the other cops did, especially on winter nights. He always made his rounds. He \\ngave his stores a lot of protection, a lot of service. When winos  and drunks filtered up \\nfrom the Bowery to panhandle on  his beat he got rid of them so roughly that they never \\ncame back. The tradespeople in his precin ct appreciated it. And they showed their \\nappreciation. \\nHe also obeyed the system. The bookies in his precinct knew he would never make \\ntrouble to get an extra payoff for himself, that he was cont ent with his share of the \\nstation house bag. His name was on the list with the others and he never tried to make \\nextras. He was a fair cop who took only cle an graft and his rise in the police department \\nwas steady if not spectacular. \\nDuring the time he was raising a large fam ily of four sons, none of whom became \\npolicemen. They all went to Fordham Univer sity and since by that time Mark McCluskey \\nwas rising from sergeant to  lieutenant and finally to captain, they lacked for nothing. It \\nwas at this time that McCluskey got t he reputation for being a hard bargainer. The \\nbookmakers in his district paid more protection money than the bookmakers in any other \\npart of the city, but maybe t hat was because of the expens e of putting four boys through \\ncollege. \\nMcCluskey himself felt there was nothing wr ong with clean graft. Why the hell should his \\nkids go to CCNY or a cheap  Southern college just becaus e the Police Department didn’t \\npay its people enough money to live on and ta ke care of their families properly? He \\nprotected all these people with his life and his record showed  his citations for gun duels \\nwith stickup men on his beat, strong-arm protection guys,  would-be pimps. He had \\nhammered them into the ground. He  had kept his little corner of the city safe for ordinary \\npeople and he sure as hell was entitled to mo re than his lousy one C note a week. But \\nhe wasn’t indignant a bout his low pay, he underst ood that everybody had to take care of \\nthemselves.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 117\\nBruno Tattaglia was an old friend of his. Bruno had gone to Fordham  with one of his \\nsons and then Bruno had opened his nightcl ub and whenever the McCluskey family \\nspent an infrequent night on the town, they could enjoy the cabaret with liquor and \\ndinner– on the house. On Ne w Year’s Eve they received engraved invitations to be \\nguests of the management and always receiv ed one of the best tables. Bruno always \\nmade sure they were introduced to the celebrities who performed in his club, some of them famous singers and Hollyw ood stars. Of course sometime s he asked a little favor, \\nlike getting an employee with a record clear ed for a cabaret work license, usually a \\npretty girl with a police dossier as a hustler  or roller. McCluskey would be glad to oblige. \\nMcCluskey made it a policy never to show t hat he understood what other people were \\nup to. When Sollozzo had approached him wit h the proposition to leave old man \\nCorleone uncovered in the hospital, McCluskey didn’t ask why. He  asked price. When \\nSollozzo said ten grand, McCluskey knew why. He did not hesit ate. Corleone was one \\nof the biggest Mafia men in t he country with more political connections than Capone had \\never had. Whoever knocked him off would be doing the country a big favor. McCluskey \\ntook the money in advance and did the job. When he receiv ed a call from Sollozzo that \\nthere were still two of Corleone’s men in front  of the hospital he had flown into a rage. \\nHe had locked up all of Tessio’ s men, he had pulled the detec tive guards off the door of \\nCorleone’s hospital room. And now, being a man of principle, he would have to give \\nback the ten grand, money he had already ea rmarked to insure the education of his \\ngrandchildren. It was in that rage that he had gone to the hospita l and struck Michael \\nCorleone. \\nBut it had all worked out for the best. He had me t with Sollozzo in the Tattaglia nightclub \\nand they had made an even better deal. Again McCluskey didn’t ask questions, since he \\nknew all the answers. He just made sure of his price. It never occurred to him that he \\nhimself could be in any danger. That anyone w ould consider even for a moment killing a \\nNew York City police captain was too fantastic. The toughes t hood in the Mafia had to \\nstand still if the lowliest pat rolman decided to slap him around. There was absolutely no \\npercentage in killing cops. Because then all of a su dden a lot of hoods were killed \\nresisting arrest or escaping the scene of  a crime, and who the hell was going to do \\nanything about that? \\nMcCluskey sighed and got ready to leave the station house. Problems, always \\nproblems. His wife’s sister in Ireland had just died after many years of fighting cancer \\nand that cancer had cost him a pretty penny. Now the funeral would cost him more. His  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 118\\nown uncles and aunts in the old country needed a little help no w and then to keep their \\npotato farms and he sent the money to do the trick. He didn’t begrudge it. And when he \\nand his wife visited the old country they were treated like a king and queen. Maybe they \\nwould go again this summer now that the wa r was over and with all this extra money \\ncoming in. McCluskey told his patrolman cler k where he would be if he was needed. He \\ndid not feel it necessary to take any prec autions. He could always claim Sollozzo was an \\ninformer he was meeting. Outside the stat ion house he walked a few blocks and then \\ncaught a cab to the house wher e he would meet with Sollozzo. \\n* * *  \\nIt was Tom Hagen who had to make all the arrangements for Michael’s leaving the \\ncountry, his false passport, his seaman’s ca rd, his berth on an Italian freighter that \\nwould dock in a Sicilian port. Emissaries were s ent that very day by plane to Sicily to \\nprepare a hiding plate with the Mafia chief in the hill country. \\nSonny arranged for a car and an absolutely trustw orthy driver to be waiting for Michael \\nwhen he stepped out of the restaurant where t he meeting would be held with Sollozzo. \\nThe driver would be Tessio himself, who had volunteered for the job. It would be a \\nbeat-up-looking car but with a fine motor. It  would have phony license  plates and the car \\nitself would be untraceable. It had been saved for a special job requiring the best. \\nMichael spent the day with Clem enza, practicing with the sm all gun that would be gotten \\nto him. It was a.22 filled with soft-nosed bul lets that made pinpricks going in and left \\ninsulting gaping holes when t hey exited from the human body . He found that it was \\naccurate up to five of his steps away from a target. After that the bullets might go anywhere. The trigger was tight  but Clemenza worked on this with some tools so that it \\npulled easier. They decided to leave it noisy. They didn’t want an innocent bystander \\nmisunderstanding the situation a nd interfering out of ignorant courage. The report of the \\ngun would keep them away from Michael. \\nClemenza kept instructing hi m during the training session. “Drop the gun as soon as \\nyou’ve finished using it. Just let your hand drop to your side an d the gun slip out. \\nNobody will notice. Everybody will think you’re  still armed. They’ll be staring at your \\nface. Walk out of the place very quickly but don’t run. Don’t look anybody directly in the \\neye but don’t look away from  them either. Remember, they ’ll be scared of you, believe \\nme, they’ll be scared of you. No body will interfere. As soon as you’re outside Tessio will \\nbe in the car waiting for you. Get in and le ave the rest to him. Don’t be worried about  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 119\\naccidents. You’d be surprised how well these affairs go. Now put this hat on and let’s \\nsee how you look.” He clapped a gray fedor a on Michael’s head. Michael, who never \\nwore a hat, grimaced. Clemenza reassured him. “It helps against identification, just in \\ncase. Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to  change their identification when we make \\nthem see the light. Remember, Mike, don’t wo rry about prints. The butt and trigger are \\nfixed with special tape. Don’t touch any other part of the gun,  remember that.” \\nMichael said, “Has Sonny found out where Soliozzo is taking me?” \\nClemenza shrugged. “Not yet. So llozzo is being very carefu l. But don’t worry about him \\nharming you. The negotiator stays in our hands until you come back safe. If anything \\nhappens to you, the negotiator pays.” \\n“Why the hell should he stick his neck out?” Michael asked. \\n“He gets a big fee,” Clemenza sa id. “A small fortune. Also he is an important man in the \\nFamilies. He knows Sollozzo can’t let anythi ng happen to him. Your life is not worth the \\nnegotiator’s life to Sollozzo. Very simple. Y ou’ll be safe all right. We’re the ones who \\ncatch hell afterwards.” \\n“How bad will it be?” Michael asked. \\n“Very bad,” Clemenza said. “It means an all-out  war with the Tattaglia Family against the \\nCorleone Family. Most of t he others will line up with the Tattaglias. The Sanitation \\nDepartment will be sweeping up a lot of dead bodies this winter.” He shrugged. “These \\nthings have to happen once every ten years or so. It gets rid of the bad blood. And then \\nif we let them push us around on the little things they wanta take over everything. You \\ngotta stop them at the begin ning. Like they shoulda st opped Hitler at Munich, they \\nshould never let him get away with that, they  were just asking for big trouble when they \\nlet him get away with that.” \\nMichael had heard his father say this same  thing before, only in 1939 before the war \\nactually started. If the Families had be en running the State Department there would \\nnever have been World War II, he thought with a grin. \\nThey drove back to the mall and to the Don’s house, w here Sonny still made his \\nheadquarters. Michael wondered how long Sonny could stay cooped up in the safe \\nterritory of the mall. Eventually he would have to venture out. They found Sonny taking a nap on the couch. On the coffee table was the re mains of his late lunch, scraps of steak \\nand bread crumbs and a half-empty bottle of whiskey.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 120\\nHis father’s usually neat offi ce was taking on the look of  a badly kept furnished room. \\nMichael shook his brother awake and said, “W hy don’t you stop living like. a bum and \\nget this place cleaned up?” \\nSonny yawned. “What the hell  are you, inspecting the barracks? Mike, we haven’t got \\nthe word yet where they plan to take you, those bastards Sollozzo and McCluskey. If we \\ndon’t find that out, how the hell are we going to get the gun to you?” \\n“Can’t I carry it on me?” Michael asked. “May be they won’t frisk me and even if they do \\nmaybe they’ll miss it if we’re smart enough. And even if they fi nd it– so what. They’ll just \\ntake it off me and no harm done.” \\nSonny shook his head. “Nah,” he said. “We have to make this a sure hit on that bastard \\nSollozzo. Remember, get him first if you po ssibly can. McCluskey is slower and dumber. \\nYou should have plenty of time to take him. Did Clemenza tell you to be sure to drop the \\ngun?” \\n“A million times,” Michael said. \\nSonny got up from the sofa and stretc hed. “How does your jaw feel, kid?” \\n“Lousy,” Michael said. The left side of his face  ached except those parts that felt numb \\nbecause of the drugged wire holding it together. He took the bottle of whiskey from the \\ntable and swigged directly from it. The pain eased. \\nSonny said, “Easy, Mike, now is no time to get slowed up by booze.” \\nMichael said, “Oh, Christ, Sonny, stop play ing the big brother. I’ve been in combat \\nagainst tougher guys than Sollozzo and under worse conditions. Where the hell are his \\nmortars? Has he got air cover? Heavy artill ery? Land mines? He’s just a wise son of a \\nbitch with a big-wheel cop sidekick. Once anybody makes up their mind to kill them \\nthere’s no other problem. That ’s the hard part, making up your  mind. They’ll never know \\nwhat hit them.” \\nTom Hagen came into the room. He greeted them with a nod and went directly to the \\nfalsely listed telephone. He called a few time s and then shook his head at Sonny. “Not a \\nwhisper,” he said. “Sollozzo is keepi ng it to himself as long as he can.” \\nThe phone rang. Sonny answered it and he held up a hand as if to signal for quiet \\nthough no one had spoken. He jotted some notes  down on a pad, then said, “OK, he’ll \\nbe there,” and hung up the phone. \\nSonny was laughing. “That son of  a bitch Sollozzo, he really  is something. Here’s the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 121\\ndeal. At eight tonight he and Captain McClu skey pick up Mike in front of Jack \\nDempsey’s bar on Broadway. They go someplace to talk, and get this. Mike and \\nSollozzo talk in Italian so that the Irish cop don’t know what the hell they are talking \\nabout. He even tells me, don’t worry, he know s McCluskey doesn’t know one word in \\nItalian unless it’s ‘soldi’ and he’s checked you out, Mike, and knows you can understand \\nSicilian dialect.” \\nMichael said dryly, “I’m pretty  rusty but we won’t talk long.” \\nTom Hagen said, “We don’t let Mike go until we  have the negotiator. Is that arranged?” \\nClemenza nodded. “The negotiator is at my hous e playing pinochle with three of my \\nmen. They wait for a call from  me before they let him go.” \\nSonny sank back in the leather armchair. “N ow how the hell do we find out the meeting \\nplace? Tom, we’ve got informers with the Tatt aglia Family, how come they haven’t given \\nus the word?” \\nHagen shrugged. “Sollozzo is really damn smart. He’s playing this close to the vest, so \\nclose that he’s not using any men as a cover. He figures the captain will be enough and \\nthat security is more important than guns. He’s  right too. We’ll have to put a tail on Mike \\nand hope for the best.” \\nSonny shook his head. “Nah, anybody can lose a tail when they really want to. That’s \\nthe first thing they’ll check out.” \\nBy this time it was five in the afternoon. Sonny, with a worried look  on his face, said, \\n“Maybe we should just let Mike blast whoever is  in the car when it tries to pick him up.” \\nHagen shook his head. “What if Sollozzo is not  in the car? We’ve tipped our hand for \\nnothing. Damn it, we have to find out where Sollozzo is taking him.” \\nClemenza put in, “Maybe we shoul d start trying to figure why lie’s making it such a big \\nsecret.” \\nMichael said impatiently, “B ecause it’s the percentage.  Why should he let us know \\nanything if he can prevent it? Besides, he smells danger. He must be leery as hell even \\nwith that police captain for his shadow.” \\nHagen snapped his fingers. “That detective, that guy Phillips. Why don’t you give him a \\nring, Sonny? Maybe he can find out where the hell the captain can be reached. It’s \\nworth a try. McCluskey won’t give a damn who knows where he’s going.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 122\\nSonny picked up the phone and dialed a number. He spoke softly into the phone, then \\nhung up. “He’ll call us back,” Sonny said. \\nThey waited for nearly another thirty minutes and then the phone rang. It was Phillips. \\nSonny jotted something down on his pad and t hen hung up. His face was taut. “I think \\nwe’ve got it,” he said. “Captain McCluskey a lways has to leave word on where he can \\nbe reached. From eight to ten tonight he ’ll be at the Luna Azur e up in the Bronx. \\nAnybody know it?” \\nTessio spoke confidently. “I do. It’s perfect for us. A small family place with big booths where people can talk in private. Good food. Everybody minds their own business. \\nPerfect.” He leaned over Sonny’s desk and arranged stubbed-out cigarettes into map \\nfigures. “This is the entrance. Mike, when you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner. I’ll spot you and put on my head lights and catch you on the fly. If you have \\nany trouble, yell and I’ll try to come in and get you out. Clemenza, you gotta work fast. \\nSend somebody up there to plant the gun. They  got an old-fashioned toilet with a space \\nbetween the water container and the wall. Have your man tape the gun behind there. \\nMike, after they frisk you in the car and find you’re clean, they won’t be too worried \\nabout you. In the restaurant, wait a bit befor e you excuse yourself. No, better still, ask \\npermission to go. Act a little in  trouble first, very natural. They  can’t figure anything. But \\nwhen you come out again,  don’t waste any time. Don’t sit down again at the table, start \\nblasting. And don’t take chances . In the head, two shots apiece,  and out as fast as your \\nlegs can travel.” \\nSonny had been listening judiciously. “I want somebody very good, very safe, to plant \\nthat gun,” he told Clemenza. “I don’t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just \\nhis dick in his hand.” \\nClemenza said emphatically , “The gun will be there.” \\n“OK,” Sonny said. “Everybody get rolling.” \\nTessio and Clemenza left. Tom Hagen said, “Sonny, should I drive Mike down to New \\nYork?” \\n“No,” Sonny said. “I want you here. When Mi ke finishes, then our work begins and I’ll \\nneed you. Have you got those newspaper guys lined up?” \\nHagen nodded. “I’ll be feeding them in fo as soon as things break.” \\nSonny got up and came to stand in front of Michael. He shook his hand. “OK, kid,” he  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 123\\nsaid, “you’re on. I’ll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I’ll get a \\nmessage to your girl friend when I think the time is right. OK?” \\n“OK,” Mike said. “How long do yo u think before I can come back?” \\n“At least a year,” Sonny said. \\nTom Hagen put in, “The Don might be able to work faster than t hat, Mike, but don’t \\ncount on it. The time element hinges on a lot of  factors. How well we can plant stories \\nwith the newsmen. How much the Police Department wants to cover up. How violently \\nthe other Families react. There’s going to be a hell of a lot of heat and trouble. That’s the \\nonly thing we can be sure of.” \\nMichael shook Hagen’s hand. “Do your best,” he said. “I  don’t want to do another \\nthree-year stretch away from home.” \\nHagen said gently, “It’s not too late to bac k out, Mike, we can get somebody else, we \\ncan go back over our alternatives. Maybe it’s  not necessary to get rid of Sollozzo.” \\nMichael laughed. “We can talk ourselves into any viewpoint,”  he said. “But we figured it \\nright the first time. I’ve been riding the gravy tr ain all my life, it’s about time I paid my \\ndues.” \\n“You shouldn’t let that broken jaw influence you,” Hagen said. “McCluskey is a stupid man and it was busine ss, not personal.” \\nFor the second time he saw Michael Corleone’ s face freeze into a mask that resembled \\nuncannily the Don’s. “Tom, don’t let anybody kid you. It’s all personal, every bit of \\nbusiness. Every piece of shit every man has to eat every day of his life is personal. They call it business. OK. But it’s personal as he ll. You know where I learned that from? The \\nDon. My old man. The Godfather . If a bolt of lightning hit a friend of his the old man \\nwould take it personal. He took my going into the Marines personal. That’s what makes him great. The Great Don. He takes everyt hing personal. Like God. He knows every \\nfeather that falls from the tail of a sparrow or however the hell it goes. Right? And you \\nknow something? Accidents don’t happen to people who take accidents as a personal \\ninsult. So I came late , OK, but I’m coming all the way. Damn right, I take that broken jaw \\npersonal; damn right, I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal.” He laughed. “Tell the old man I learned it all from him and that I’m glad I had this chance to pay him back \\nfor all he did for me. He was a good father.”  He paused and then he said thoughtfully to \\nHagen, “You know, I can never remember hi m hitting me. Or Sonny. Or Freddie. And of \\ncourse Connie, he wouldn’t even  yell at her. And tell me the truth, Tom, how many men  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 124\\ndo you figure the Don killed or had killed.” \\nTom Hagen turned away. “I’ll tell you one thing you didn’t learn from him: talking the way \\nyou’re talking now. There are things th at have to be done and you do them and you \\nnever talk about them. You don’t try to justify them. They can’t be justified. You just do \\nthem. Then you forget it.” \\nMichael Corleone frowned. He said  quietly, “As the Consigliere, you agree that it’s \\ndangerous to the Don and our Fam ily to let Sollozzo live?” \\n“Yes,” Hagen said. \\n“OK,” Michael said. “Then I have to kill him.” \\nMichael Corleone stood in front  of Jack Dempsey’s restaurant  on Broadway and waited \\nfor his pickup. He looked at his watch. It said five minutes to eight. Sollozzo was going \\nto be punctual. Michael had ma de sure he was there in pl enty of time. He had been \\nwaiting fifteen minutes. \\nAll during the ride from Long Beach into the city he had been trying to forget what he \\nhad said to Hagen. For if he believed what he said, then his life was set on an \\nirrevocable course. And yet, could it be othe rwise after tonight? He  might be dead after \\ntonight if he didn’t stop all this crap, Mic hael thought grimly. He had to keep his mind on \\nthe business at hand. Sollozzo was no du mmy and McCluskey was a very tough egg. \\nHe felt the ache in his wired jaw and welc omed the pain, it would keep him alert. \\nBroadway wasn’t that crowded on  this cold winter night, ev en though it was near theater \\ntime. Michael flinched as a long black car pu lled up to the curb and the driver, leaning \\nover, opened the front door and said, “Get in, Mi ke.” He didn’t know the driver, a young \\npunk with slick black hair and an open shirt, but  he got in. In the back seat were Captain \\nMcCluskey and Sollozzo. \\nSollozzo reached a hand over the back of the seat and Michael shook it. The hand was \\nfirm, warm and dry. Sollozzo said, “I’m glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten \\neverything out. All this is terrible, it’s not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It \\nshould never have happened.” \\nMichael Corleone said quietly, “I hope we c an settle things tonight, I don’t want my \\nfather bothered any more.” \\n“He won’t be,” Sollozzo said sincerely. “I sw ear to you by my children he won’t be. Just \\nkeep an open mind when we talk. I hope you’re not a hothead like y our brother Sonny.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 125\\nIt’s impossible to talk business with him.” \\nCaptain McCluskey grunted. “He’s a good kid, he’ s all right.” He leaned over to give \\nMichael an affectionate pat on the shoulder. “I’m sorry about  the other night, Mike. I’m \\ngetting too old for my job, too grouchy. I guess I’ll have to retire pretty soon. Can’t stand \\nthe aggravation, all day I get ag gravation. You know how it is .” Then with a doleful sigh, \\nhe gave Michael a thorough frisk for a weapon. \\nMichael saw a slight smile on the driver’s lips. The car wa s going west with no apparent \\nattempt to elude any trailers. It went up on to  the West Side Highway, speeding in and \\nout of traffic. Anyone fo llowing would have had to do t he same. Then to Michael’s \\ndismay it took the exit for the George Washi ngton Bridge, they were  going over to New \\nJersey. Whoever had given Sonny the info  on where the meeting was to be held had \\ngiven him the wrong dope. \\nThe car threaded through the bridge approaches and then was on it, leaving the blazing \\ncity behind. Michael kept his face impassive . Were they going to dump him into the \\nswamps or was it just a last-minute change in  meeting place by the wily Sollozzo? But \\nwhen they were nearly all the way across, the driver gave the wheel a violent twist. The \\nheavy automobile jumped into the air when it hit the divider and bounced over into the \\nlanes going back to New York City. Both McCluskey and Sollozzo were looking back to \\nsee if anyone had tried doing the same thing. The driver was r eally hitting it back to New \\nYork and then they were off the bridge and going toward the East Bronx. They went \\nthrough the side streets with no cars behind t hem. By this time it was nearly nine \\no’clock. They had made sure there was no one on their tail. Sollozzo lit up a cigarette \\nafter offering his pack to McCluskey and Michael , both of whom refused. Sollozzo said \\nto the driver, “Nice wo rk. I’ll remember it.” \\nTen minutes later the car pulled up in fr ont of a restaurant in a small Italian \\nneighborhood. There was no one on the streets and because of the lateness of the hour \\nonly a few people were still at dinner. Michael  had been worried that the driver would \\ncome in with them, but he st ayed outside with his car. T he negotiator had not mentioned \\na driver, nobody had. Technically Sollozzo  had broken the agreement by bringing him \\nalong. But, Michael decided not  to mention it, knowing t hey would think he would be \\nafraid to mention it, afraid of ruining the chances for the success of the parley. \\nThe three of them sat at t he only round table, Sollozzo refusing a booth. There were \\nonly two other people in the restaurant. Michael wondered whether they were Sollozzo  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 126\\nplants. But it didn’t matter. Before they  could interfere it would be all over. \\nMcCluskey asked with real intere st, “Is the Italia n food good here?” \\nSollozzo reassured him. “Try the veal, it’s the finest in New York.” The solitary waiter \\nhad brought a bottle of wine to the table an d uncorked it. He poured three glasses full. \\nSurprisingly McCluskey did not drink. “I must be the only Irishman who don’t take the \\nbooze,” he said. “I seen too many good people get in trouble because of the booze.” \\nSollozzo said placatingly to the captain, “I  am going to talk Italian to Mike, not because I \\ndon’t trust you but because I can’t explain m yself properly in Engl ish and I want to \\nconvince Mike that I mean well, that it’s to  everybody’s advantage for us to come to an \\nagreement tonight. Don’t be insulted by th is, it’s not that I don’t trust you.” \\nCaptain McCluskey gave them both an ironic grin… “Sure, you two go right ahead,” he \\nsaid. “I’ll concentrate on my veal and spaghetti.” \\nSollozzo began speaking to Michael in rapid Sicilian. He said, “You must understand that what happened between me and  your father was strictly a business matter. I have a \\ngreat respect for Don Corleone and would beg fo r the opportunity to enter his service. \\nBut you must understand that your father is an old-fashioned man. He stands in the way \\nof progress. The business I am in is the comi ng thing, the wave of the future, there are \\nuntold millions of dollars for everyone to make. But your father stands in the way \\nbecause of certain unrealistic scruples. By doing this he imposes his will on men like \\nmyself. Yes, yes, I know, he says to me, ‘G o ahead, it’s your business,’ but we both \\nknow that is unrealistic. We must tread on eac h other’s corns. What he is really telling \\nme is that I cannot operate my business. I am a man who respects himself and cannot \\nlet another man impose his will on me so w hat had to happen did happen. Let me say \\nthat I had the support, the sil ent support of all the New York  Families. And the Tattaglia \\nFamily became my partners. If this quarrel continues, then the Corleone Family will \\nstand alone against everyone. Per haps if your father were we ll, it could be done. But the \\neldest son is not the man the Godfather is, no disrespect intended. And the Irish \\nConsigliere, Hagen, is not the man Genco Abban dando was, God rest his soul. So I \\npropose a peace, a truce. Let us  cease all hostilities until your father is well again and \\ncan take part in these bargainings. The Ta ttaglia Family agrees, upon my persuasions \\nand my indemnities, to forgo justice for thei r son Bruno. We will have peace. Meanwhile, \\nI have to make a living and will do a little tr ading in my business. I do not ask your \\ncooperation but I ask you, the Corleone Fa mily, not to interfere. These are my  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 127\\nproposals. I assume you have the authority to agree, to make a deal.” \\nMichael said in Sicilian, “Tell me more abo ut how you propose to start your business, \\nexactly what part my Family ha s to play in it and what prof it we can take from this \\nbusiness.” \\n“You want the whole proposition in detail then?” Sollozzo asked. \\nMichael said gravely, “Most im portant of all I must have sure guarantees that no more \\nattempts will be made on my father’s life.” \\nSollozzo raised his hand expressively. “Wha t guarantees can I give you? I’m the hunted \\none. I’ve missed my chance. You think too highly  of me, my friend. I am not that clever.” \\nMichael was sure now that the conference was only to gain a few days’ time. That \\nSollozzo would make another attempt to kill the Don. What was beautiful was that the \\nTurk was underrating him as a p unk kid. Michael felt that st range delicious ch ill filling his \\nbody. He made his face look distressed. So llozzo asked sharply, “What is it?” \\nMichael said with an embarrassed air, “The wine went right  to my bladder. I’ve been \\nholding it in. Is it all right  if I go to the bathroom?” \\nSollozzo was searching his face intently with his dark eyes. He reached over and \\nroughly thrust his hand in Michael’s crotch, under it and around, searching for a weapon. \\nMichael looked offended. McCluskey said curtly, “I  frisked him. I’ve frisked thousands of \\nyoung punks. He’s clean.” \\nSollozzo didn’t like it. For no reason at all he didn’t like it. He glanced at the man sitting \\nat a table opposite them and raised his eyebro ws toward the door of the bathroom. The \\nman gave a slight nod that he  had checked it, that there was nobody inside. Sollozzo \\nsaid reluctantly, “Don’t take too long.” He had marvelous antenna, he was nervous. \\nMichael got up and went into t he bathroom. The urinal had a pink bar of soap in it \\nsecured by a wire net. He went into the boot h. He really had to go, his bowels were \\nloose. He did it very quickly, then reached behind the enam el water cabinet until his \\nhand touched the small, blun t-nosed gun fastened with tape. He ripped the gun loose, \\nremembering that Clemenza had said not to worry about leav ing prints on the tape. He \\nshoved the gun into his waistband and buttoned hi s jacket over it. He washed his hands \\nand wet his hair. He wiped his prints off the faucet with hi s handkerchief. Then he left \\nthe toilet. \\nSollozzo was sitting directly facing the door of the toilet, his dark eyes blazing with  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 128\\nalertness. Michael gave a smile. “Now I can talk,” he said with a sigh of relief. \\nCaptain McCluskey was eating the plate of v eal and spaghetti that had arrived. The man \\non the far wall had been stiff with att ention, now he too relaxed visibly. \\nMichael sat down again. He re membered Clemenza had told him not to do this, to come \\nout of the toilet and blaze away . But either out of some warn ing instinct or sheer funk he \\nhad not done so. He had felt that if he ha d made one swift move he would have been \\ncut down. Now he felt safe and he must have been scared because he was glad he was \\nno longer standing on his legs. They  had gone weak with trembling. \\nSollozzo was leaning toward him. Michael, hi s belly covered by the table, unbuttoned his \\njacket and listened intently. He could not un derstand a word the man was saying. It was \\nliterally gibberish to him.  His mind was so filled with pounding blood that no word \\nregistered. Underneath the table his righ t hand moved to the gun tucked into his \\nwaistband and he drew it free. At  that moment the waiter came to take their order and \\nSollozzo turned his head to spea k to the waiter. Michael thrust the table away from him \\nwith his left hand and his right hand shoved the gun almost against Sollozzo’s head. The \\nman’s coordination was so acute that he had already begun to fling himself away at \\nMichael’s motion. But Michael, younger, his re flexes sharper, pulled the trigger. The \\nbullet caught Sollozzo squarely between his eye and his ear and wh en it exited on the \\nother side blasted out a huge gout of blood and skull fragment s onto the petrified \\nwaiter’s jacket. Instinctively Michael kn ew that one bullet was enough. Sollozzo had \\nturned his head in that last moment and he had seen the light of life die in the man’s \\neyes as clearly as a candle goes out. \\nOnly one second had gone by as Michael pi voted to bring the gun to bear on \\nMcCluskey. The police captain wa s staring at Sollozzo with ph legmatic surprise, as if \\nthis had nothing to do with him. He did no t seem to be aware of his own danger. His \\nveal-covered fork was suspended in his hand a nd his eyes were just turning on Michael. \\nAnd the expression on his face, in his eyes , held such confident outrage, as if now he \\nexpected Michael to surrender or  to run away, that Michael smiled at him as he pulled \\nthe trigger. This shot was bad, not mortal . It caught MeCluskey in his thick bull-like \\nthroat and he started to choke lo udly as if he had swallowed too large a bite of the veal. \\nThen the air seemed to fill with a fine mist of  sprayed blood as he coughed it out of his \\nshattered lungs. Very coolly, very deliberatel y, Michael fired the next shot through the \\ntop of his white-haired skull.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 129\\nThe air seemed to be full of pink mist. Mic hael swung toward the man sitting against the \\nwall. This man had not made a move. He seemed paralyzed. Now he carefully showed \\nhis hands on top of the table and looked away. The waiter was staggering back toward \\nthe kitchen, an expression of horror on his face, staring at Michael in  disbelief. Sollozzo \\nwas still in his chair, the si de of his body propped up by the table. McCluskey, his heavy \\nbody pulling downward, had fallen off his chai r onto the floor. Michael  let the gun slip out \\nof his hand so that it bound off his body a nd made no noise. He saw that neither the \\nman against the wall nor the waiter had noticed him dropping the gun. He st rode the few \\nsteps toward the door and opened it. Sollozzo’s  car was parked at the curb still, but \\nthere was no sign of the dr iver. Michael turned left and around the corner. Headlights \\nflashed on and a battered sedan pulled up to him,  the door swinging open. He jumped in \\nand the car roared away. He saw that it was Tessio at the wheel, his trim features hard \\nas marble. \\n“Did you do the job on So llozzo?” Tessio asked. \\nFor that moment Michael was struck by the idiom Tessio had used. It was always used \\nin a sexual sense, to do t he job on a woman meant seducing her. It was curious that \\nTessio used it now. “Both of them,” Michael said. \\n“Sure?” Tessio asked. \\n“I saw their brains,” Michael said. \\nThere was a change of clothes for Michael in  the car. Twenty minutes later he was on \\nan Italian freighter slated for Sicily. Two hours la ter the freighter put out to sea and from \\nhis cabin Michael could see the lights of New Yo rk City burning like the fires of hell. He \\nfelt an enormous sense of relief. He was ou t of it now. The feeling was familiar and he \\nremembered being taken off the beach of an is land his Marine division had invaded. The \\nbattle had been still going on but he had received a slight wound and was being ferried \\nback to a hospital ship. He had felt the same overpowering relief then that he felt now. \\nAll hell would break loose but he wouldn’t be there. \\n \\n* * *  \\n \\nOn the day after the murder of Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, the police captains and \\nlieutenants in every stat ion house in New York  City sent out the wo rd: there would be no  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 130\\nmore gambling, no more prostitution, no more  deals of any kind until the murderer of \\nCaptain McCluskey was caught. Massive raids began all over  the city. All unlawful \\nbusiness activities came to a standstill. \\nLater that day an emissary from the Families asked the Corleone Family if they were \\nprepared to give up the murderer. They were to ld that the affair did not concern them. \\nThat night a bomb exploded in the Corleone Family mall in Lo ng Beach, thrown from a \\ncar that pulled up to the chain, then roared aw ay. That night also two button men of the \\nCorleone Family were killed as they peaceably ate their dinner in a small Italian \\nrestaurant in Greenwich Village. The Five Families War of 1946 had begun. \\nBook Two  \\nChapter 12 \\nJohnny Fontane waved a casual dismissal to t he manservant and said, “See you in the \\nmorning, Billy.” The colored butler bowed his way out of the huge dining room-living \\nroom with its view of  the Pacific Ocean. It was a frie ndly-goodbye sort of bow, not a \\nservant’s bow, and given only because Johnny Fontane had company for dinner. \\nJohnny’s company was a girl named Sharon M oore, a New York City Greenwich Village \\ngirl in Hollywood to try for a small part in  a movie being produced by an old flame who \\nhad made the big time. She had visited the set while Johnny was acting in the Woltz \\nmovie. Johnny had found her young and fr esh and charming and witty, and had asked \\nher to come to his place for dinner that ev ening. His invitations to dinner were always \\nfamous and had the force of royalt y and of course she said yes. \\nSharon Moore obviously, expected him to come on very strong because of his reputation, but Johnny hated th e Hollywood “piece of meat ” approach. He never slept \\nwith any girl unless there was something about her he really liked. Except, of course, \\nsometimes when he was very drunk and found himself in bed with a girl he didn’t even \\nremember meeting or seeing bef ore. And now that he was thir ty-five years old, divorced \\nonce, estranged from his se cond wife, with maybe a t housand pubic scalps dangling \\nfrom his belt, he simply wasn’t that eager. But there was something about Sharon Moore \\nthat aroused affection in him and so he had invited her to dinner. \\nHe never ate much but he knew young pretty  girls ambitiously starved themselves for \\npretty clothes and were usually big eaters on a date so there was pl enty of food on the \\ntable. There was also plenty of liquor; c hampagne in a bucket, scotch, rye, brandy and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 131\\nliqueurs on the sideboard. Johnny served the drinks and t he plates of food already \\nprepared. When they had finished eating he led her into the huge li ving room with its \\nglass wall that looked out onto t he Pacific. He put a stack of Ella Fitzgerald records on \\nthe hifi and settled on the couc h with Sharon. He made a littl e small talk with her, found \\nout about what she had been like as a kid, whether she had been a tomboy or boy \\ncrazy, whether she had been homely or pre tty, lonely or gay. He always found these \\ndetails touching, it always evoked the tenderness he needed to make love. \\nThey nestled together on the sofa, very friendly,  very comfortable. He kissed her on the \\nlips, a cool friendly kiss, and wh en she kept it that way he le ft it that way. Outside the \\nhuge picture window he could see the dark blue sheet of the Pacific lying flat beneath \\nthe moonlight. \\n“How come you’re not playing any of your records?” Sharon asked him. Her voice was \\nteasing. Johnny smiled at her . He was amused by her teasing him. “I’m not that \\nHollywood,” he said. \\n“Play some for me,” she said. “Or sing for me. You know, like the movies. I’ll bubble up \\nand melt all over you just like those girls do on the screen.” \\nJohnny laughed outright. When he had been younger, he had done just such things and \\nthe result had always been stagy, the girls trying to look sexy and melting, making their \\neyes swim with desire for an imagined fantasy camera. He would never dream of \\nsinging to a girl now; for one thing, he hadn’t sung for months, he didn’t trust his voice. \\nFor another thing, amateurs di dn’t realize how much pr ofessionals depended on \\ntechnical help to sound as good as they did. He could have played his records but he \\nfelt the same shyness about hearing his yout hful passionate voice as an aging, balding \\nman running to fat feels about sh owing pictures of himself as a youth in the full bloom of \\nmanhood. \\n“My voice is out of shape,” he said. “And hones tly, I’m sick of hearing myself sing.” \\nThey both sipped their drin ks. “I hear you’re great in this picture,” she said. “Is it true you \\ndid it for nothing?” \\n“Just a token payment,” Johnny said. \\nHe got up to give her a refill on her brandy glass, gave her a gold-monogrammed \\ncigarette and flashed his lighter out to hold t he light for her. She puffed on the cigarette \\nand sipped her drink and he sat down beside her again. His glass had considerably \\nmore brandy in it than hers,  he needed it to warm himself, to  cheer himself, to charge  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 132\\nhimself up. His situation was the reverse of the lover’s usual one. He had to get himself \\ndrunk instead of the girl. The girl was usually too willing w here he was not. The last two \\nyears had been hell on his ego, and he used this simple way to restore it, sleeping with \\na young fresh girl for one night, taking her to dinner a few times, giving her an expensive \\npresent and then brushing her off in  the nicest way possible so that her feelings wouldn’t \\nbe hurt. And then they could always say they  had had a thing wit h the great Johnny \\nFontane. It wasn’t true love, but you couldn’t  knock it if the girl was beautiful and \\ngenuinely nice. He hated the hard, bitchy o nes, the ones who screwed for him and then \\nrushed off to tell their friends that they’d  screwed the great Johnny Fontane, always \\nadding that they’d had better. What amazed him more than any thing else in his career \\nwere the complaisant husbands who almost told him to his face that they forgave their \\nwives since it was allowed for even the most virtuous matron to be unfaithful with a great \\nsinging and movie star like Johnny F ontane. That really floored him. \\nHe loved Ella Fitzgerald on records. He lov ed that kind of clean si nging, that kind of \\nclean phrasing. It was the only thing in life he really understood and he knew he \\nunderstood it better than anyone else on earth. No w lying back on the couch, the brandy \\nwarming his throat, he felt a desire to sing, not music, but to phrase with the records, yet \\nit was something impossible to do in front of  a stranger. He put his free hand in Sharon’s \\nlap, sipping his drink from his other hand. Without any slyness but with the sensualness \\nof a child seeking warmth, his hand in her l ap pulled up the silk of her dress to show \\nmilky white thigh above the sheer netted gold of her stockings and as  always, despite all \\nthe women, all the years, al l the familiarity, Johnny felt  the fluid sticky warmness \\nflooding through his body at that sight. Th e miracle still happened, and what would he \\ndo when that failed him as his voice had? \\nHe was ready now. He put his drink down on the long inlaid cocktail table and turned his body toward her. He was very sure, very de liberate, and yet tender . There was nothing \\nsly or lecherously lascivious in his caresse s. He kissed her on the lips while his hands \\nrose to her breasts. His hand fell to her warm thighs, the skin so silky to his touch. Her \\nreturning kiss was warm but not  passionate and he preferred it  that way right now. He \\nhated girls who turned on all of a sudden as if  their bodies were motors galvanized into \\nerotic pumpings by the touching of a hairy switch. \\nThen he did something he always did, some thing that had never yet failed to arouse \\nhim. Delicately and as lightly as it was possible to do so and still feel something, he \\nbrushed the tip of his middle finger deep down  between her thighs. Some girls never  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 133\\neven felt that initial move toward lovemaking. Some were distracted by it, not sure it was \\na physical touch because at the same time  he always kissed them deeply on the mouth. \\nStill others seemed to suck in his finger or gobble it up with a pelvic thrust. And of \\ncourse before he became famous, some gi rls had slapped his face. It was his whole \\ntechnique and usually it served him well enough. \\nSharon’s reaction was unusual. She accepted it a ll, the touch, the kiss, then shifted her \\nmouth off his, shifted her body  ever so slightly back along the couch and picked up her \\ndrink. It was a cool but definite refusal. It happened sometimes. Rarely; but it happened. \\nJohnny picked up his drink and lit a cigarette. \\nShe was saying something very sweetly, very lightly. “It’s not that  I don’t like you, \\nJohnny, you’re much nicer than I thought you’d be.  And it’s not because I’m not that kind \\nof a girl. It’s just that I have to be turned on to do it with a guy, you know what I mean?” \\nJohnny Fontane smiled at her. He still lik ed her. “And I don’t turn you on?” \\nShe was a little embarrassed. “Well, you kn ow, when you were so great singing and all, \\nI was still a little kid. I sort of just missed you, I was the next generation. Honest, it’s not \\nthat I’m goody-goody. If you were a movie star I grew up on, I’d have my panties off in a \\nsecond.” \\nHe didn’t like her quite so much now. She was sweet, she was witty, she was intelligent. \\nShe hadn’t fallen all over herself to screw for him or try to hustle him because his \\nconnections would help her in show biz. She was really a straight kid. But there was \\nsomething else he recognized. It had happened a few times before. The girl who went \\non a date with her mind all made up not to go to bed with hi m, no matter how much she \\nliked him, just so that she could tell her  friends, and even more, herself, that she had \\nturned down a chance to screw for the gr eat Johnny Fontane. It was something he \\nunderstood now that he was olde r and he wasn’t angry. He just didn’t like her quite that \\nmuch and he had really liked her a lot. \\nAnd now that he didn’t like he r quite so much, he relaxed mo re. He sipped his drink and \\nwatched the Pacific Ocean. She said, “I hope you’re not sore, Johnny. I guess I’m being \\nsquare, I guess in Hollywood a girl’s supposed to put out just as casually as kissing a \\nbeau good night. I just haven’t been around long enough.” \\nJohnny smiled at her and patted her cheek. His hand fell down to pull her skirt discreetly over her rounded silken knees. “I’m not sore,”  he said. “It’s nice having an old-fashioned \\ndate.” Not telling what he felt: the relief at not having to prove himself a great lover, not  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 134\\nhaving to live up to his screened , godlike image. Not having to li sten to the girl trying to \\nreact as if he really had lived up  to that image, making more out of a very simple, routine \\npiece of ass than it really was. \\nThey had another drink, shared a few more cool kisses and then she decided to go. \\nJohnny said politely, “Can I call you for dinner some night?” \\nShe played it frank and honest to the end. “I know you don’t w ant to waste your time and \\nthen get disappointed,” she said. “Thanks for a wonderful evening. Someday I’ll tell my \\nchildren I had supper with the great Johnny  Fontane all alone in his apartment.” \\nHe smiled at her. “And that yo u didn’t give in,” he said. They both laughed. “They’ll \\nnever believe that,” she said. And then Johnny, being a little phony in his turn, said, “I’ll \\ngive it to you in writing, want me to?” She shook her h ead. He continued on. “Anybody \\ndoubts you, give me a buzz on the phone, I’ll stra ighten them right out. I’ll tell them how I \\nchased you all around the apartment but  you kept your honor. OK?” \\nHe had, finally, been a little too cruel and he felt stricken at  the hurt on her young face. \\nShe understood that he was telli ng her that he hadn’t tried too hard. He had taken the \\nsweetness of her victory away from her. Now she would feel that it had been her lack of \\ncharm or attractiveness that had made her the victor this night. And being the girl she \\nwas, when she told the story of how she re sisted the great Johnny  Fontane, she would \\nalways have to add with a wry little smile, “Of course, he didn’t try very hard.” So now \\ntaking pity on her, he said, “If y ou ever feel real down, give me a ring. OK? I don’t have \\nto shack up every girl I know.” \\n“I will,” she said. She went out the door. \\nHe was left with a long evening before him. He could have used what Jack Woltz called \\nthe “meat factory,” the stable of willing starlets, but he wanted human companionship. \\nHe wanted to talk like a hum an being. He thought of his firs t wife, Virginia. Now that the \\nwork on the picture was finish ed he would have more time for the kids. He wanted to \\nbecome part of their life aga in. And he worried about Virgin ia too. She wasn’t equipped \\nto handle the Hollywood sharpies who might come  after her just so that they could brag \\nabout having screwed Johnny Fontane’s first wife.  As far as he knew, nobody could say \\nthat yet. Everybody could say it about his second wife though, he thought wryly. He \\npicked up the phone. \\nHe recognized her voice immediately and that  was not surprising. He had heard it the \\nfirst time when he was ten year s old and they had been in 4B  together. “Hi, Ginny,” he  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 135\\nsaid, “you busy tonight? Can I co me over for a little while?” \\n“All right,” she said. “The kids are sleeping  though; I don’t want to wake them up.” \\n“That’s OK,” he said. “I just  wanted to talk to you.” \\nHer voice hesitated slightly, then carefully controlled not to show any concern, she \\nasked, “Is it anything serious, anything important?” \\n“No,” Johnny said. “I finished the picture to day and I thought maybe I could just see you \\nand talk to you. Maybe I could take a look at the kids if you’re sure they won’t wake up.” \\n“OK,” she said. “I’m glad you got that part you wanted.” \\n“Thanks,” he said. “I’ll see you in about a half hour.” \\nWhen he got to what had been his home in Beverly Hills, Johnny Fontane sat in the car \\nfor a moment staring at the house. He reme mbered what his Godfather had said, that he \\ncould make his own life what he wanted. Great chance if you knew what you wanted. \\nBut what did he want? \\nHis first wife was waiting for him at the door . She was pretty, petite and brunette, a nice \\nItalian girl, the girl next door who would nev er fool around with another man and that \\nhad been important to hi m. Did he still want her, he as ked himself, and the answer was \\nno. For one thing, he could no longer make love  to her, their affection had grown too old. \\nAnd there were some things, nothing to do wit h sex, she could never forgive him. But \\nthey were no longer enemies. \\nShe made him coffee and served him homemade c ookies in the living room. “Stretch out \\non the sofa,” she said, “you look tired.” He took off his jacket and his shoes and \\nloosened his tie while she sat in the chair opposite him with a grave little smile on her \\nface. “It’s funny,” she said. \\n“What’s funny?” he asked her, sipping coffee and spilling some of it on his shirt. \\n“The great Johnny Fontane stu ck without a date,” she said. \\n“The great Johnny Fontane is lucky if he can even get it up anymore,” he said. \\nIt was unusual for him to be so direct. Ginny  asked, “Is there something really the \\nmatter?” \\nJohnny grinned at her. “I had a da te with a girl in my apartm ent and she brushed me off. \\nAnd you know, I was relieved.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 136\\nTo his surprise he saw a look of anger pass over Ginny’s face. “Don’t worry about those \\nlittle tramps,” she said. “She must have thought that was the way to get you interested in \\nher.” And Johnny realized wit h amusement that Ginny was actually angry with the girl \\nwho had turned him down. \\n“Ah, what the hell,” he said. “I’m tired of that stuff. I have to grow up sometime. And now \\nthat I can’t sing anymore I guess I’ll have a tough time with dames. I never got in on my \\nlooks, you know.” \\nShe said loyally, “You were always better looking than you photographed.” \\nJohnny shook his head. “I’m getting fat and I’m ge tting bald. Hell, if this picture doesn’t \\nmake me big again I better learn how to ba ke pizzas. Or maybe we’ll put you in the \\nmovies, you look great.” \\nShe looked thirty-five. A good th irty-five, but thirty-five. A nd out here in Hollywood that \\nmight as well be a hundred. The young beautif ul girls thronged through the city like \\nlemmings, lasting one year, some two. Some of them so beautiful they could make a \\nman’s heart almost stop beating until they o pened their mouths, until the greedy hopes \\nfor success clouded the loveliness of their ey es. Ordinary women could never hope to \\ncompete with them on a physical level. A nd you could talk all you wanted to about \\ncharm, about intelligence, about chic, about poise, the raw beauty of these girls \\noverpowered everything else. Per haps if there were not so many of them there might be \\na chance for an ordinary, nice-looking woman.  And since Johnny Fontane could have all \\nof them, or nearly all of them, Ginny knew t hat he was saying all this  just to flatter her. \\nHe had always been nice that way. He had always been polite to women even at the \\nheight of his fame, paying them compliments, holding lights for their cigarettes, opening \\ndoors. And since an this was usually done for him, it made it even more impressive to \\nthe girls he went out with. And he did it with all girls,  even the one-night stands, \\nI-don’t-know-your-name girls. \\nShe smiled at him, a friendly smile. “Y ou already made me, Johnny, remember? For \\ntwelve years. You don’t have to give me your line.” \\nHe sighed and stretched out on the sofa. “No kidding, Ginny, you look good. I wish I \\nlooked that good.” \\nShe didn’t answer him. She could see he wa s depressed. “Do you think the picture is \\nOK? Will it do you some good?” she asked. \\nJohnny nodded. “Yeah. It could bring me all the way back. If I get the Academy thing  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 137\\nand play my cards right, I can make it big again even without the singing. Then maybe I \\ncan give you and the kids more dough.” \\n“We have more than enough,” Ginny said. \\n“I wants see more of the kids too,” Johnny said. “I want to settle down a little bit. Why \\ncan’t I come every Friday night for dinner he re? I swear I’ll never miss one Friday, I don’t \\ncare how far away I am or how busy I am. And then whenever I can I’ll spend weekends \\nor maybe the kids can spend some part of their vacations with me.” \\nGinny put an ashtray on his chest. “It’s OK with me,” she said. “I never got married \\nbecause I wanted you to keep being their father.” She said this without any kind of \\nemotion, but Johnny Fontane, staring up at the ceiling, knew she said it as an \\natonement for those other things, the cruel th ings she had once said to him when their \\nmarriage had broken up, when his career ha d started going down the drain. \\n“By the way, guess who called me,” she said. \\nJohnny wouldn’t play that game,  he never did. “Who?” he asked. \\nGinny said, “You could take at least one lousy guess.” Johnny didn’t answer. “Your \\nGodfather,” she said. \\nJohnny was really surprised. “He never talks to anybody on the phone. What did he say \\nto you?” \\n“He told me to help you,” Ginny said. “He sa id you could be as big as you ever were, \\nthat you were on your way back, but that y ou needed people to belie ve in you. I asked \\nhim why should I? And he said because you’re the father of my ch ildren. He’s such a \\nsweet old guy and they tell such horrible stories about him.” \\nVirginia hated phones and she had had all the extensions taken out except for the one \\nin her bedroom and one in the kitchen. Now they could hear the kitchen phone ringing. \\nShe went to answer it. When she came back in to the living room there was a look of \\nsurprise on her face. “It’s for you, Johnny ,” she said. “It’s Tom Hagen. He says it’s \\nimportant.” \\nJohnny went into the kitchen and pi cked up the phone. “Yeah, Tom,” he said. \\nTom Hagen’s voice was cool. “Johnny, the G odfather wants me to come out and see \\nyou and set some things up that can help you out now that the pict ure is finished. He \\nwants me to catch the morning plane. Can you meet it in Los Angeles? I have to fly back \\nto New York the same night so you won’t have to worry about keeping your night free for  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 138\\nme.” \\n“Sure, Tom,” Johnny said. “And don’t worry about me losing a night. Stay over and relax \\na bit. I’ll throw a party and you can meet some movie people.” He always made that \\noffer, he didn’t want the folks from his old neighborhood to th ink he was ashamed of \\nthem. \\n“Thanks,” Hagen said, “but I really have to  catch the early morning plane back. OK, \\nyou’ll meet the eleven-thirty A.M. out of New York?” \\n“Sure,” Johnny said. \\n“Stay in your car,” Hagen said . “Send one of your people to meet me when I get off the \\nplane and bring me to you.” \\n“Right,” Johnny said. \\nHe went back to the living room and Ginny l ooked at him inquiringly. “My Godfather has \\nsome plan for me, to help me out,” Johnny said. “He got me the part in the movie, I don’t \\nknow how. But I wish he’d stay out of the rest of it.” \\nHe went back onto the sofa. He felt very ti red. Ginny said, “Why don’t you sleep in the \\nguest bedroom tonight instead of going home? You can have breakfast with the kids \\nand you won’t have to drive home so late. I hate to think of you all al one in that house of \\nyours anyway. Don’t you get lonely?” \\n“I don’t stay home much,” Johnny said. \\nShe laughed and said, “Then you haven’t changed much.” She paused and then said, \\n“Shall I fix up the other bedroom?” \\nJohnny said, “Why can’t I sleep in your bedroom?” \\nShe flushed. “No,” she said. She smiled at  him and he smiled back. They were still \\nfriends. \\nWhen Johnny woke up the next morning it was late, he could tell by the sun coming in \\nthrough the drawn blinds. It never came in t hat way unless it was in the afternoon. He \\nyelled, “Hey, Ginny, do I still rate breakfast?” And far away he heard her voice call, “Just \\na second.” \\nAnd it was just a second. S he must have had everything ready , hot in the oven, the tray \\nwaiting to be loaded, because as Johnny lit his fast cigarette of the day, the door of the \\nbedroom opened and his two small daughters came in wheeli ng the breakfast cart.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 139\\nThey were so beautiful it broke his heart. T heir faces were shining and clear, their eyes \\nalive with curiosity and the ea ger desire to run to him. They wore their hair braid \\nold-fashioned in long pigtails and th ey wore old-fashioned frocks and white \\npatent-leather shoes. They stood by the breakfast cart watching him as he stubbed out \\nhis cigarette and waited for him to call and hold his arms wide. Then they came running \\nto him. He pressed his face between thei r two fresh fragrant cheeks and scraped them \\nwith his beard so that they shrieked. Ginny appeared in the bedroom door and wheeled the breakfast cart the rest of  the way so that he could eat  in bed. She sat beside him on \\nthe edge of the bed, pouring his coffee, buttering his toast. The two young daughters sat \\non the bedroom couch watching him. They were too old now for pillow fights or to be \\ntossed around. They were already smoothing their mussed hair. Oh, Christ, he thought, \\npretty soon they’ll be all grown up, Hollywood punks will be out after them. \\nHe shared his toast and bacon wit h them as he ate, gave them  sips of coffee. It was a \\nhabit left over from when he had been singing with the band and rarely ate with them so \\nthey liked to share his food when he had hi s odd-hour meals like a fternoon breakfasts or \\nmorning suppers. The change- around in food delight ed them– to eat steak and french \\nfries at seven in the morning, bacon and eggs in the afternoon. \\nOnly Ginny and a few of his close friends  knew how much he idolized his daughters. \\nThat had been the worst thing about the divo rce and leaving home. The one thing he \\nhad fought about, and for, was his pos ition as a father to them. In a very sly way he had \\nmade Ginny understand he  would not be pleas ed by her remarrying, not because he \\nwas jealous of her, but because he was jealous  of his position as a father. He had \\narranged the money to be paid to her so it  would be enormously to her advantage \\nfinancially not to remarry. It was understood that she could ha ve lovers as long as they \\nwere not introduced into her hom e life. But on this score he had absolute faith in her. \\nShe had always been amazingly shy and old-fa shioned in sex. The Hollywood gigolos \\nhad batted zero when they started swarmi ng around her, sniffing for the financial \\nsettlement and the favors they could get from her famous husband. \\nHe had no fear that she expected a reconc iliation because he had wanted to sleep with \\nher the night before. Neither  one of them wanted to renew their old marriage. She \\nunderstood his hunger for beauty, his irresistible impulse toward young women far more beautiful than she. It was known that he alwa ys slept with his movie co-stars at least \\nonce. His boyish charm was irresistible to them, as their beauty was to him. \\n“You’ll have to start getting dressed pretty  soon,” Ginny said. “Tom’s plane will be  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 140\\ngetting in.” She shooed the daughters out of the room. \\n“Yeah,” Johnny said. “By the way, Ginny, you know I’m getting divorced? I’m gonna be a \\nfree man again.” \\nShe watched him getting dressed. He always kept fresh clothes at her house ever since \\nthey had come to their new arrangement after the wedding of Don Co rleone’s daughter. \\n“Christmas is only two weeks away,” she said. “Shall I plan on you being here?” \\nIt was the first time he had even thought about  the holidays. When his voice was in \\nshape, holidays were lucrative singing dates but even then Christmas was sacred. If he \\nmissed this one, it would be the second one. Last year he had  been courting his second \\nwife in Spain, trying to get her to marry him. \\n“Yeah,” he said. “Christmas Eve and Christmas. ” He didn’t mention New Year’s Eve. \\nThat would be one of the wild nights he needed ev ery once in a while, to get drunk with \\nhis friends, and he didn’t want a wife alon g then. He didn’t feel guilty about it. \\nShe helped him put on his jacket and brushed it  off. He was always fastidiously neat. \\nShe could see him frowning because the shir t he had put on was not laundered to his \\ntaste, the cuff links, a pair he had not worn fo r some time, were a little too loud for the \\nway he liked to dress now. She laughed softly and said, “Tom won’t notice the \\ndifference.” \\nThe three women of the family  walked him to the door and out on the driveway to his \\ncar. The two little girls held his hands, one on each side. His wife walked a little behind \\nhim. She was getting pleasure ou t of how happy he looked. When he reached his car he \\nturned around and swung each girl in turn hi gh up in the air and kissed her on the way \\ndown. Then he kissed his wife and got into t he car. He never liked drawn-out good-byes. \\n* * *  \\nArrangements had been made by hi s PR man and aide. At his house a chauffeured car \\nwas waiting, a rented car. In  it were the PR man and anot her member of his entourage. \\nJohnny parked his car and hopped in and they were on their way to the airport. He \\nwaited inside the car while t he PR man went out to meet  Tom Hagen’s plane. When \\nTom got into the car they shook hands and drove back to his house. \\nFinally he and Tom were alone in the living room. There was a coolness between them. Johnny had never forgiven Hagen for acting as a barrier to his getting in touch with the \\nDon when the Don was angry wit h him, in those bad days before Connie’s wedding.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 141\\nHagen never made excuses for his actions. He coul d not. It was part of his job to ad as \\na lightning rod for resentments which people were too awed to feel toward the Don \\nhimseif though he had earned them. \\n“Your Godfather sent me out  here to give you a hand on some things,” Hagen said. “I \\nwanted to get it out of the way before Christmas.” \\nJohnny Fontane shrugged. “The picture is finish ed. The director was a square guy and \\ntreated me right. My scenes are too important to be left on the cutting-room floor just for \\nWoltz to pay me off. He can’t ruin a ten-million-dollar picture.  So now everything \\ndepends on how good people think I am in the movie.” \\nHagen said cautiously, “Is winning this Ac ademy Award so terribly important to an \\nactor’s career, or is it just the usual publicity crap that really doesn’t mean anything one \\nway or the other?” He paused and added hastily, “Except of c ourse the glory, everybody \\nlikes glory.” \\nJohnny Fontane grinned at him. “Except my Godfather. And you. No, Tom, it’s not a lot \\nof crap. An Academy Award can make an actor for ten years. He can get his pick of \\nroles. The public goes to see him. It’s not ev erything, but for an actor it’s the most \\nimportant thing in the busine ss. I’m counting on winning it. Not because I’m such a great \\nactor but because I’m known primarily as a singer and the part is foolproof. And I’m pretty good too, no kidding.” \\nTom Hagen shrugged and said, “Your Godfather tells me that the wa y things stand now, \\nyou don’t have a chance of winning the award.” \\nJohnny Fontane was angry. “What the hell are you talking about? The picture hasn’t \\neven been cut yet, much less shown. And t he Don isn’t even in the movie business. \\nWhy the hell did you fly the thre e thousand miles just to tell me that shit?” He was so \\nshaken he was almost in tears. \\nHagen said worriedly, “Johnny, I don’t know a damn thing about all this movie stuff. \\nRemember, I’m just a messenger boy for the Don. But we have discussed this whole \\nbusiness of yours many times. He worries about you, about your future. He feels you \\nstill need his help and he wants to settle your  problem once and for all. That’s why I’m \\nhere now, to get things rolling. But you have to start growing up , Johnny. You have to \\nstop thinking about yourself as a singer or an actor. You’ve got to  start thinking about \\nyourself as a prime mover, as a guy with muscle.” \\nJohnny Fontane laughed and filled his glass. “If I don’t win that Oscar I’ll have as much  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 142\\nmuscle as one of my daughters. My voice is gone;  if I had that back I could make some \\nmoves. Oh, hell. How does my Godfather know  I won’t win it? OK, I believe he knows. \\nHe’s never been wrong.” \\nHagen lit a thin cigar. “We got the word th at Jack Woltz won’t spend studio money to \\nsupport your candidacy. In fact he’s sent the word out to everybody who votes that he \\ndoes not want you to win. But holding back the money for ads and all that may do it. \\nHe’s also arranging to have one other guy get  as much of the opposition votes as he \\ncan swing. He’s using all so rts of bribes– jobs, money, broads, everything. And he’s \\ntrying to do it without hurting the picture or hurting it as little as possible.” \\nJohnny Fontane shrugged. He f illed his glass with whiskey and downed it. “Then I’m \\ndead.” \\nHagen was watching hi m with his mouth curled up with di staste. “Drinking won’t help \\nyour voice,” he said. \\n“Fuck you,” Johnny said. \\nHagen’s face suddenly became smoothly impa ssive. Then he said, “OK, I’ll keep this \\npurely business.” \\nJohnny Fontane put his drink down and went over to stand in front  of Hagen. “I’m sorry I \\nsaid that, Tom,” he said. “Christ, I’m sorry. I’m taking it out on you because I wanta kill \\nthat bastard Jack Woltz and I’m afraid to tell off my Godfather. So I get sore at you.” \\nThere were tears in his eyes. He threw the empty whiskey gl ass against the wall but so \\nweakly that the heavy shot gl ass did not even shatter and rolled along the floor back to \\nhim so that he looked down at it in baffled  fury. Then he laughed. “Jesus Christ,” he \\nsaid. \\nHe walked over to the other  side of the room and sat oppos ite Hagen. “You know, I had \\neverything my own way for a long time. T hen I divorced Ginny and everything started \\ngoing sour. I lost my voice. My records stopped selling. I didn’t  get any more movie \\nwork. And then my Godfather got sore at me and wouldn’t talk to me on the phone or \\nsee me when I came into New York. You we re always the guy barring the path and I \\nblamed you, but I knew you wo uldn’t do it without orders from  the Don. But you can’t get \\nsore at him. It’s like getting sore at God. So  I curse you. But you’ve been right all along \\nthe line. And to show you I mean my apology  I’m taking your advice. No more booze \\nuntil I get my voice back. OK?” \\nThe apology was sincere. Hagen forgot his anger. There must be something to this  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 143\\nthirty-five-year-old boy or the Don would not be so fond of him. He said, “Forget it, \\nJohnny.” He was embarrassed at the depth of  Johnny’s feeling and embarrassed by the \\nsuspicion that it might have been inspired by fear, fear t hat he might turn the Don \\nagainst him. And of course the Don could never be turned by anyone for any reason. \\nHis affection was mutable only by himself. \\n“Things aren’t so bad,” he told Johnny. “The Don says he can cancel out everything \\nWoltz does against you. That y ou will almost certainly win t he Award. But he feels that \\nwon’t solve your problem. He wants to know if you have the brains  and balls to become \\na producer on your own, make your own movies from top to bottom.” \\n“How the hell is he going to get me the Award?” Johnny asked incredulously. \\nHagen said sharply, “How do yo u find it so easy to believe that Woltz can finagle it and \\nyour Godfather can’t? Now sinc e it’s necessary to get your faith for the other part of our \\ndeal I must tell you this. Just keep it to yourself. Your Godfather is a much more powerful man than Jack Woltz. And he is much more powerful in areas far more critical. \\nHow can he swing the Award? He  controls, or controls the people who control, all the \\nlabor unions in the industry , all the people or nearly all the people who vote. Of course \\nyou have to be good, you have to be in contention on your own merits. And your Godfather has more brains than Jack Woltz. He doesn’t go up to these people and put a \\ngun to their heads and say, ‘Vote for Johnny F ontane or you are out of a job.’ He doesn’t \\nstrong-arm where strong-arm doesn’t work or leaves too many hard feelings. He’ll make \\nthose people vote for you because they want to. But they won’t want to unless he takes \\nan interest. Now just take my word for it t hat he can get you the Award. And that if he \\ndoesn’t do it, you won’t get it.” \\n“OK,” Johnny said. “I believe you. And I have the balls and brains to be a producer but I \\ndon’t have the money. No bank would finance me . It takes millions to support a movie.” \\nHagen said dryly, “When you get  the Award, start making pl ans to produce three of your \\nown movies. Hire the best people in the busine ss, the best technicians, the best stars, \\nwhoever you need. Plan on three to five movies.” \\n“You’re crazy,” Johnny said. “That many movies could mean twenty million bucks.” \\n“When you need the money,” Hagen said, “get in touch with me. I’ll give you the name of the bank out here in California to ask for fi nancing. Don’t worry, they finance movies all \\nthe time. Just ask them for the money in t he ordinary way, with the proper justifications, \\nlike a regular business deal. They will approve.  But first you have to see me and tell me  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 144\\nthe figures and the plans. OK?” \\nJohnny was silent for a long time. Then he said quietly, “Is t here anything else?” \\nHagen smiled. “You mean, do you have to do any fa vors in return for a loan of twenty \\nmillion dollars? Sure you will.” He waited for Johnny to say something. “Nothing you \\nwouldn’t do anyway if the Don asked you to do it for him.” \\nJohnny said, “The Don has to ask me himself if  it’s something serious, you know what I \\nmean? I won’t take your wo rd or Sonny’s for it.” \\nHagen was surprised by this good sense. F ontane had some brains after all. He had \\nsense to know that the Don was too fond of him, and too smart, to ask him to do \\nsomething foolishly dangerous, whereas Sonny might. He said to Johnny, “Let me \\nreassure you on one thing. Y our Godfather has given me and Sonny strict instructions \\nnot to involve you in any way in anything th at might get you bad publicity, through our \\nfault. And he will never do that  himself. I guarantee you that any favor he asks of you, \\nyou will offer to do before he requests it. OK?” \\nJohnny smiled. “OK,” he said. \\nHagen said, “Also he has faith in you. He thinks you have brains and so he figures the \\nbank will make money on the investment; which means he will make money on it. So it’s \\nreally a business deal, never  forget that. Don’t go scre wing around with the money. You \\nmay be his favorite godson but twenty million bu cks is a lot of dough. He has to stick his \\nneck out to make sure you get it.” \\n“Tell him not to worry,” Johnny said. “If a guy like Jack Woltz can be a big movie genius, \\nanybody can.” \\n“That’s what your Godfather figures,” Hagen said. “Can you have me driven back to the \\nairport? I’ve said all I have to say. When you do start signing contracts for everything, \\nhire your own lawyers, I won’t be in on it. Bu t I’d like to see everything before you sign, if \\nthat’s OK with you. Also, you’ll never have any  labor troubles. That will cut costs on your \\npictures to some extent, so when the account ants lump some of that in, disregard those \\nfigures.” \\nJohnny said cautiously, “Do I have to get your OK on anything else, scripts, slats, any of \\nthat?” \\nHagen shook his head. “No,” he aid. “It may happen that the Don would object to \\nsomething but he’ll object to you direct if  he does. But I can’t imagine what that would  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 145\\nbe. Movies don’t affect him at all, in any way, so he has no interest. And he doesn’t \\nbelieve in meddling, that I can tell you from experience.” \\n“Good,” Johnny said. “I’ll drive you to the air port myself. And thank the Godfather for me. \\nI’d call him up and thank him but he never comes to the phone. Why is that, by the \\nway?” \\nHagen shrugged. “He hardly ever talks on the phone. He doesn’t want his voice \\nrecorded, even saying something perfectly innoc ent. He’s afraid that they can splice the \\nwords together so that it sounds  as if he says something else . I think that’s what it is. \\nAnyway his only worry is that someday he’ll be framed by the author ities. So he doesn’t \\nwant to give them an edge.” \\nThey got into Johnny’s car and drove to t he airport. Hagen was thinking that Johnny was \\na better guy than he figured. He’d already learned something, just his driving him \\npersonally to the airport proved that. The pe rsonal courtesy, something the Don himself \\nalways believed in. And the apology. That  had been sincere. He had known Johnny a \\nlong time and he knew the apology would never be made out of fear. Johnny had \\nalways had guts. That’s wh y he had always been in trouble, with hi s movie bosses and \\nwith his women. He was also one of the fe w people who was not af raid of the Don. \\nFontane and Michael were mayb e the only two men Hagen knew  of whom this could be \\nsaid. So the apology was sincere, he would accept it as such. He and Johnny would have to see a lot of each other in the next few years. And Johnny would have to pass \\nthe next test, which would pr ove how smart he was. He wo uld have to do something for \\nthe Don that the Don would never ask him to  do or insist that he do as part of the \\nagreement. Hagen wondered if Johnny Fontane was smart enough to figure out that \\npart of the bargain. \\n* * *  \\nAfter Johnny dropped Hagen off at the air port (Hagen insisted that Johnny not hang \\naround for his plane with him) he drove back to Ginny’s house. She was surprised to \\nsee him. But he wanted to stay at her place so  that he would have time to think things \\nout, to make his plans. He knew that what  Hagen had told him was extremely important, \\nthat his whole life was bei ng changed. He had once been a big star but now at the \\nyoung age of thirty-five he was washed up. He didn’t kid himself about that. Even if he \\nwon the Award as best actor, what the hell could it mean at  the most? Nothing, if his \\nvoice didn’t come back. He’d be just second-rate, with no real  power, no real juice. Even  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 146\\nthat girl turning him down, she had been nice and smart and acting sort of hip, but would \\nshe have been so cool if he had really been  at the top? Now with the Don backing him \\nwith dough he could be as big as anybody in Hollywood. He could be a king. Johnny \\nsmiled. Hell. He could even be a Don. \\nIt would be nice living with Ginny again for a few weeks, maybe longer. He’d take the \\nkids out every day, maybe have a few friends  over. He’d stop drinking and smoking, \\nreally take care of himself. Maybe his voice would get strong  again. If that happened \\nand with the Don’s money, he’d be unbeatable. He ’d really be as close to an oldtime \\nking or emperor as it was possible to be in  America. And it wouldn’t depend on his voice \\nholding up or how long the public cared about him as an actor. It would be an empire \\nrooted in money and the most special,  the most coveted kind of power. \\nGinny had the guest bedroom made up for him. It was un derstood that he would not \\nshare her room, that they wo uld not live as man and wife. They could never have that \\nrelationship again. And though the outside worl d of gossip columnists and movie fans \\ngave the blame for the failure of their marriage solely to him, yet in a curious way, \\nbetween the two of them, they both knew t hat she was even more to blame for their \\ndivorce. \\nWhen Johnny Fontane because the most popu lar singer and movie musical comedy \\nstar in motion pictures, it had never occurr ed to him to desert his wife and children. He \\nwas too Italian, still too old-style. Naturally he had been unfaithful. That had been \\nimpossible to avoid in his business and the temptations to which he was continually \\nexposed. And despite being a skinny, delicate-looking guy, he had the wiry horniness of \\nmany small-boned Latin types. And women delight ed him in their surprises. He loved \\ngoing out with a demure sweet-faced virgi nal-looking girl and then uncapping her \\nbreasts to find them so unexpec tedly slopingly full and rich, lewdly heavy in contrast to \\nthe cameo face. He loved to find sexual sh yness and timidity in the sexy-looking girls \\nwho were all fake motion like a shifty basketba ll player, vamping as if they had slept with \\na hundred guys, and then when he got them alone having to battle for hours to get in \\nand do the job and finding out they were virgins. \\nAnd all these Hollywood guys la ughed at his fondness for virgins. They called it an old \\nguinea taste, square, and look ho w long it took to make a virg in give you a blow job with \\nall the aggravation and then they usually tur ned out to be a lousy piece of ass. But \\nJohnny knew that it was how you handled a young girl. You had to come on to her the \\nright way and then what could be  greater than a girl who wa s tasting her first dick and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 147\\nloving it? Ah, it was so great breaking them  in. It was so great having them wrap their \\nlegs around you. Their thighs were all diffe rent shapes, their asses were different, their \\nskins were all different colors and shades  of white and brown and tan and when he had \\nslept with that young colored girl in Detroi t, a good girl, not a hustler, the young daughter \\nof a jazz singer on the same nightclub bill with him, she had been one of the sweetest \\nthings he had ever had. He r lips had really tasted like warm honey with pepper mixed in \\nit, her dark brown skin was rich, creamy, and she had been as sweet as God had ever \\nmade any woman and she had been a virgin. \\nAnd the other guys were always talking about  blow jobs, this and other variations, and \\nhe really didn’t enjoy that stuff so much. He never liked a girl t hat much after they tried it \\nthat way, it just didn’t sati sfy him right. He and his second wife had finally not got along, \\nbecause she preferred the old sixty-nine too much to a point where she didn’t want \\nanything else and he had to fight to stick it  in. She began making fun of him and calling \\nhim a square and the word got around that he made love like a kid. Maybe that was why \\nthat girl last night had turned him down. Well, the hell with i t, she wouldn’t be too great in \\nthe sack anyway. You could tell a girl who really liked to fuck and they were always the \\nbest. Especially the ones who h adn’t been at it too long. What  he really hated were the \\nones who had started scre wing at twelve and were all fuck ed out by the time they were \\ntwenty and just going through the motions and some  of them were the prettiest of all and \\ncould fake you out. \\nGinny brought coffee and cake into his bedroom  and put it on the long table in the sitting \\nroom part. He told her simply that Hagen was helping him put together the money credit \\nfor a producing package and she was excited about that. He would be important again. \\nBut she had no idea of how po werful Don Corleone really was so she didn’t understand \\nthe significance of Hagen coming from New York. He told her H agen was also helping \\nwith legal details. \\nWhen they had finished the coff ee be told her he was going to work that night, and \\nmake phone calls and plans for t he future. “Half of all this wil l be in the kids’ names,” he \\ntold her. She gave him a grateful smile an d kissed him good night before she left his \\nroom. \\nThere was a glass dish full of his favori te monogrammed cigarettes, a humidor with \\npencil-thin black Cuban cigars on his writi ng desk. Johnny tilted back and started \\nmaking calls. His brain was really whirring along. He called the aut hor of the book, the \\nbest-selling novel, on which his new film wa s based. The author wa s a guy his own age  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 148\\nwho had come up the hard way and was now a ce lebrity in the liter ary world. He had \\ncome out to Hollywood expecting to be tr eated like a wheel and, lik e most authors, had \\nbeen treated like shit. Johnny had seen the humil iation of the author one night at the \\nBrown Derby. The writer had been fixed up wit h a well-known bosomy starlet for a date \\non the town and a sure shack-up later. But wh ile they were at dinner the starlet had \\ndeserted the famous author because a ratty-looking movie comic had waggled his finger \\nat her. That had given the writ er the right slant on just w ho was who in the Hollywood \\npecking order. It didn’t matter that his book had made him world famous. A starlet would \\nprefer the crummiest, the ra ttiest, the phoniest movie wheel. \\nNow Johnny called the author at his New York  home to thank him for the great part he \\nhad written in his book for him. He flattered the shit out of  the guy. Then casually he \\nasked him how he was doing on his next novel and what it was all about. He lit a cigar \\nwhile the author told him about  a specially interesting c hapter and then finally said, \\n“Gee, I’d like to read it w hen you’re finished. How about sending me a copy? Maybe I \\ncan get you a good deal for it, better than you got with Woltz.” \\nThe eagerness in the author’s  voice told him that he  had guessed right. Woltz had \\nchiseled the guy, given him peanuts for the book . Johnny mentioned that he might be in \\nNew York right after the holidays and would the author want to come and have dinner \\nwith some of his friends. “I know a few goo d-looking broads,” Johnny said jokingly. The \\nauthor laughed and said OK. \\nNext Johnny called up the director and came raman on the film he ha d just finished to \\nthank them for having helped him in the film. He told them confidentially that he knew \\nWoltz had been against him and he doubly appreciated their help  and that if there was \\never anything he could do for them they should just call. \\nThen he made the hardest call of  all, the one to Jack Woltz. He thanked him for the part \\nin the picture and told him ho w happy he would be to work for him anytime. He did this \\nmerely to throw Woltz off the track. He had always been very square, very straight. In a \\nfew days Woltz would find out about his maneuvering and be astounded by the \\ntreachery of this call, which was exactl y what Johnny Fontane wanted him to feel. \\nAfter that he sat at the desk and puffed at his cigar. There was whiskey on a side table \\nbut he had made some sort of promise to hi mself and Hagen that he wouldn’t drink. He \\nshouldn’t even be smoking. It was foolish; whatever was wrong with his voice probably \\nwouldn’t be helped by knocking off drinking and smoking. Not too much, but what the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 149\\nhell, it might help and he wanted all the perc entages with him, now that he had a fighting \\nchance. \\nNow with the house quiet, his divorced wife sl eeping, his beloved daughters sleeping, \\nhe could think back to that terrible time in  his life when he had deserted them. Deserted \\nthem for a whore tramp of a bitch who was his second wife. But even now he smiled at \\nthe thought of her, she was such  a lovely broad in so many  ways and, besides, the only \\nthing that saved his life was the day that he had made up his mind never to hate a \\nwoman or, more specifically, t he day he had decided he could not afford to hate his first \\nwife and his daughters, his girl friends, his second wife, and t he girl friends after that, \\nright up to Sharon Moore brushing him off so that she could brag about refusing to \\nscrew for the great Johnny Fontane. \\n* * *  \\nHe had traveled with the band singing and t hen he had become a radi o star and a star \\nof the movie stage shows and th en he had finally made it in t he movies. And in all that \\ntime he had lived the way he wanted to, scr ewed the women he wanted to, but he had \\nnever let it affect his personal life. Then he had fallen for his soon to be second wife, \\nMargot Ashton; he had gone absolutely crazy fo r her. His career had gone to hell, his \\nvoice had gone to hell, his family life had gone to hell. And there had come the day \\nwhen he was left without anything. \\nThe thing was, he had always been generous  and fair. He had given his first wife \\neverything he owned when he di vorced her. He had made sure his two daughters would \\nget a piece of everything he made, every re cord, every movie, every club date. And \\nwhen he had been rich and famous he had refus ed his first wife nothing. He had helped \\nout all her brothers and sister s, her father and mother, the girl friends she had gone to \\nschool with and their families. He had never been a stuck-up celebrity. He had sung at \\nthe weddings of his wife’s two younger sister s, something he hated to do. He had never \\nrefused her anything except the comple te surrender of his own personality. \\nAnd then when he had touched bottom, when he could no longer get movie work, when \\nhe could no longer sing, when his second wife had betrayed him,  he had gone to spend \\na few days with Ginny and his daughters. He had more or less flung himself on her \\nmercy one night because he felt so lousy. T hat day he had heard one of his recordings \\nand he had sounded so terrible that he accused the song technicians of sabotaging the \\nrecord. Until finally he had become convinc ed that that was what his voice really  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 150\\nsounded like. He had smashed the master record and refused to sing anymore. He was \\nso ashamed that he had not sung a note except with Ni no at Connie  Corleone’s \\nwedding. \\nHe had never forgotten the look on Ginny’s face when she found out about all his misfortunes. It had passed over her face only for a second but that was enough for him \\nnever to forget it. It was a look of savage and joyful satisfaction. It was a look that could \\nonly make him believe that she had contem ptuously hated him all these years. She \\nquickly recovered and offered him cool but polite sympathy. He had pretended to accept it. During the next few days he had gone to s ee three of the girls he had liked the most \\nover the years, girls he had remained frie nds with and sometimes still slept with in a \\ncomradely way, girls that he had done everything in his power to help, girls to whom he \\nhad given the equivalent of hundreds  of thousands of dollars in  gifts or job opportunities. \\nOn their faces he had caught that same fleeting look of savage satisfaction. \\nIt was during that time that he knew he had to  make a decision. He could become like a \\ngreat many other men in Hollywood, successful producers,  writers, directors, actors, \\nwho preyed on beautiful women with lustful hatred. He could use power and monetary \\nfavors grudgingly, always alert for treason, a lways believing that women would betray \\nand desert him, adversaries to be bested.  Or he could refuse to hate women and \\ncontinue to believe in them. \\nHe knew he could not afford not to love them, that something of his sp irit would die if he \\ndid not continue to love women no matter ho w treacherous and unfaithful they were. It \\ndidn’t matter that t he women he loved most in the world were secretly glad to see him \\ncrushed, humiliated, by a waywar d fortune; it did not matter that in the most awful way, \\nnot sexually, they had been unfaithful to him. He had no choice. He had to accept them. And so he made love to all of  them, gave them presents, hid the hurt their enjoyment of \\nhis misfortunes gave him. He forgave them  knowing he was being paid back for having \\nlived in the utmost freedom from women and in the fullest flush of their favor. But now \\nhe never felt guilty about being untrue to them. He never fe lt guilty about how he treated \\nGinny, insisting on remaining the sole father of his children, yet never even considering \\nremarrying her, and letting her know that too.  That was one thing he had salvaged out of \\nhis fall from the top. He had grown a th ick skin about the hurts he gave women. \\nHe was tired and ready for bed but one note of memory stuck with him: singing with \\nNino Valenti. And suddenly he knew what  would please Don Corleone more than \\nanything else. He picked up the phone and told  the operator to get him New York. He  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 151\\ncalled Sonny Corleone and a sked him for Nino Valenti’s number. Then he called Nino. \\nNino sounded a little drunk as usual. \\n“Hey, Nino, how’d you like to come out here and work for me,” Johnny said. “I need a \\nguy I can trust.” \\nNino, kidding around, said, “Gee, I don’t know, Johnny, I got a good job on the truck, \\nboffing housewives along my route, picking up a clear hundred-fifty every week. What \\nyou got to offer?” \\n“I can start you at five hun dred and get you blind dates with movie stars, how’s that?” \\nJohnny said. “And maybe I’ll let you sing at my parties.” \\n“Yeah, OK, let me think about it.”  Nino said. “Let me talk it over with my lawyer and my \\naccountant and my helper on the truck.” \\n“Hey, no kidding around, Nino,” Johnny said. “I need you out here. I want you to fly out \\ntomorrow morning and sign a personal contra ct for five hundred a week for a year. Then \\nif you steal one of my broads and I fire you, you pick up at least a year’s salary. OK?” \\nThere was a long pause. Nino’s voice wa s sober. “Hey, Johnny, you kidding?” \\nJohnny said, “I’m serious, kid. Go to my agent’s office in New York. They’ll have your plane ticket and some cash. I’m gonna call them first thing in the morning. So you go up \\nthere in the afternoon. OK? Then I’ll have somebody meet you at the plane and bring \\nyou out to the house.” \\nAgain there was a long pause and then Nino’s voice, very  subdued, uncertain, said, \\n“OK, Johnny.” He didn’t sound drunk anymore. \\nJohnny hung up the phone and got ready for bed. He felt better than any time since he \\nhad smashed that master record. \\nChapter 13  \\nJohnny Fontane sat in the huge recording st udio and figured costs on a yellow pad. \\nMusicians were filing in, all of them fri ends he had known since he was a kid singer with \\nthe bands. The conductor, top man in the business of pop accom paniment and a man \\nwho had been kind to him when things went s our, was giving each musician bundles of \\nmusic and verbal instructions. His name was Eddie Neils. He had taken on this \\nrecording as a favor to Johnny , though his schedule was crowded. \\nNino Valenti was sitting at a piano fooling around nervously with the keys. He was also  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 152\\nsipping from a huge glass of rye. Johnny didn ’t mind that. He knew Nino sang just as \\nwell drunk as sober and what they were  doing today wouldn’t require any real \\nmusicianship on Nino’s part. \\nEddie Neils had made special arrangements of some old Italian and Sicilian songs; and \\na special job on the duel-duet song that  Nino and Johnny had sung at Connie \\nCorleone’s wedding. Johnny was making the re cord primarily because he knew that the \\nDon loved such songs and it would be a perf ect Christmas gift for him. He also had a \\nhunch that the record would sell in the high numbers, not a million, of course. And he \\nhad figured out that helping Nino was how the Don wanted his pa yoff. Nino was, after \\nall, another one of the Don’s godchildren. \\nJohnny put his clipboard and yellow pad on the folding chai r beside him and got up to \\nstand beside the piano. He said, “Hey, pais an,” and Nino glanced up and tried to smile. \\nHe looked a little sick. Johnny  leaned over and rubbed his shou lder blades. “Relax, kid,” \\nhe said. “Do a good job today and I’ll fix you up with the best and most famous piece of \\nass in Hollywood.” \\nNino took a gulp of whiskey. “Who’s that, Lassie?” \\nJohnny laughed. “No, Deanna Dunn. I guarantee the goods.” \\nNino was impressed but couldn’t help saying with pseudo-hopefulness, “You can’t get \\nme Lassie?” \\nThe orchestra swung into the opening song  of the medley. Johnny Fontane listened \\nintently. Eddie Neils would pl ay all the songs through in their special arrangements. \\nThen would come the first take  for the record. As Johnny listened he made mental notes \\non exactly how he would handle each phrase, how he would co me into each song. He \\nknew his voice wouldn’t last long, but Nino would be doing most of the singing, Johnny would be singing under him. Except of course  in the duet-duel song . He would have to \\nsave himself for that. \\nHe pulled Nino to his feet  and they both stood by their microphones. Nino flubbed the \\nopening, flubbed it again. His face was b eginning to get red with embarrassment. \\nJohnny kidded him, “Hey, you stalling for overtime?” \\n“I don’t feel natural without my mandolin,” Nino said. \\nJohnny thought that over for a moment. “Hold that glass of booze in your hand,” he said. \\nIt seemed to do the trick. Nino kept drinking from the glass as he sang but he was doing  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 153\\nfine. Johnny sang easily, not straining, his voice merely dancing around Nino’s main \\nmelody. There was no emotional  satisfaction in this kind of singing but he was amazed \\nat his own technical skill. Ten years of vocalizing had taught him something. \\nWhen they came to the duet-duel song that  ended the record, Johnny let his voice go \\nand when they finished his vocal cords ache d. The musicians had been carried away by \\nthe last song, a rare thing for these ca lloused veterans. They hammered down their \\ninstruments and stamped their feet in approval as applause. The drummer gave them a \\nruffle of drums. \\nWith stops and conferences t hey worked nearly four hours before they quit. Eddie Neils \\ncame over to Johnny and said quietly, “Y ou sounded pretty good, kid. Maybe you’re \\nready to do a record. I have a new  song that’s perfect for you.” \\nJohnny shook his head. “Come on,  Eddie, don’t kid me. Besides, in a couple of hours I’ll \\nbe too hoarse to even talk. Do you think we’ll have to fix up much of the stuff we did today?” \\nEddie said thoughtfully, “Ni no will have to come into the studio tomorrow. He made \\nsome mistakes. But he’s much better than I thought he would be . As for your stuff, I’ll \\nhave the sound engineers fix anything I don’t like. OK?” \\n“OK,” Johnny said. “When can I hear the pressing?” \\n“Tomorrow night,” Eddie Neils said. “Your place?” \\n“Yeah,” Johnny said. “Thanks, Eddie. See you tomorrow.” He took Nino by the arm and \\nwalked out of the studio. They went  to his house instead of Ginny’s. \\nBy this time it was late afternoon. Nino was still more than half-drunk. Johnny told him to \\nget under the shower and then ta ke a snooze. They had to be  at a big party at eleven \\nthat night. \\nWhen Nino woke up, Johnny briefed him. “Thi s party is a movie star Lonely Hearts \\nClub,” he said. “These broads tonight are dames  you’ve seen in the movies as glamour \\nqueens millions of guys would give their right arms to screw. And the only reason they’ll \\nbe at the party tonight is to find somebody to shack t hem up. Do yov know why? \\nBecause they are hungry for it, t hey are just a little old. And just like every dame, they \\nwant it with a little bit of class.” \\n“What’s the matter with your voice?” Nino asked. \\nJohnny had been speaking almost in a whisper. “Every time a fter I sing a little bit that  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 154\\nhappens. I won’t be able to sing for a month now. But I’ll get over the hoarseness in a \\ncouple of days.” \\nNino said thoughtfully, “Tough, huh?” \\nJohnny shrugged. “Listen, Nino,  don’t get too drunk tonight. You have to show these \\nHollywood broads that my paisan buddy ain’t weak in the poop. You gotta come across. \\nRemember, some of these dames are very power ful in movies, they can get you work. It \\ndoesn’t hurt to be charming afte r you knock off a piece.” \\nNino was already pouring himself a drink. “I’m always charming,” he said. He drained \\nthe glass. Grinning, he ask ed, “No kidding, can you rea lly get me close to Deanna \\nDunn?” \\n“Don’t be so anxious,” Johnny said. “I t’s not going to be like you think.” \\n* * *  \\nThe Hollywood Movie Star Lonely Hearts Club (so called by the young juvenile leads whose attendance was mandatory) met every Friday night at the palatial, studio-owned \\nhome of Roy McElroy, press agent or rather  public relations counsel for the Woltz \\nInternational Film Corporation. Actually, though it was McElroy’ s open house party, the \\nidea had come from the practical brai n of Jack Woltz himself. Some of his \\nmoney-making movie stars were getting older now. Without the help of special lights \\nand genius makeup men they lo oked their age. They were having problems. They had \\nalso become, to some extent, desensitized physically and mentally. They could no \\nlonger “fall in love.” They could no longer as sume the role of hunted women. They had \\nbeen made too imperious; by money, by fame, by their former beauty. Woltz gave his \\nparties so that it would be easier for them to pick up lovers, one-night stands, who, if \\nthey had the stuff, could graduate into fu ll-time bed partners and so work their way \\nupward. Since the action some times degenerated into brawls or sexual excess that led \\nto trouble with the police, Woltz decided to hold the parties in the house of the public \\nrelation counselor, who would be right there to fix things up, pay off newsmen and police \\nofficers and keep everything quiet. \\nFor certain virile young male actors on the studio payroll who had not yet achieved stardom or featured roles, attendance at t he Friday night parties was not always \\npleasant duty. This was explain ed by the fact that a new film yet to be released by the \\nstudio would be shown at the party. In fact that was the excuse for the party itself. \\nPeople would say, “Let’s go over to see w hat the new picture so  and so made is like.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 155\\nAnd so it was put in a professional context. \\nYoung female starlets were forbidden to a ttend the Friday night parties. Or rather \\ndiscouraged. Most of them took the hint. \\nScreenings of the new movies took place at midnight and Johnny and Nino arrived at \\neleven. Roy McElroy proved to be, at first sight, an enormously likable man, \\nwell-groomed, beautifully dre ssed. He greeted Johnny Font ane with a surprised cry of \\ndelight. “What the hell are you doing her e?” he said with genuine astonishment. \\nJohnny shook his hand. “I’m showing my c ountry cousin the sights. Meet Nino.” \\nMcElroy shook hands with Nino and gazed at him appraisingly. “They’ll eat him up \\nalive,” he said to Johnny. He led them to the rear patio. \\nThe rear patio was really a series of huge rooms whose glass doors had been opened \\nto a garden and pool. There were almost  a hundred people milli ng around, all with \\ndrinks in their hands. The patio  lighting was artfully arranged to flatter feminine faces \\nand skin. These were women Nino had se en on the darkened movie screens when he \\nhad been a teenager. They had played their part in  his erotic dreams of adolescence. \\nBut seeing them now in the flesh was lik e seeing them in some horrible makeup. \\nNothing could hide the tiredness of their sp irit and their flesh; time had eroded their \\ngodhead. They posed and moved as charmingl y as he remembered but they were like \\nwax fruit, they could not lubr icate his glands. Nino took two drinks, wandered to a table \\nwhere he could stand next to  a nest of bottles. Johnny moved with him. They drank \\ntogether until behind them came t he magic voice of Deanna Dunn. \\nNino, like millions of other men, had that voice imprinted on his brain forever. Deanna \\nDunn had won two Academy Awards, had been in  the biggest movie grosser made in \\nHollywood. On the screen she had a feline femi nine charm that made her irresistible to \\nall men. But the words she was saying had never been heard on the silver screen. \\n“Johnny, you bastard, I had to go to my p sychiatrist again because you gave me a \\none-night stand. How come you never came back for seconds?” \\nJohnny kissed her on her proffered cheek. “You wore me out for a month,” he said. “I \\nwant you to meet my cousin Nino. A nice strong Italian boy. Maybe he can keep up with \\nyou.” \\nDeanna Dunn turned to give Nino a cool look. “Does he like to watch previews?” \\nJohnny laughed. “I don’t think he’s ever had the chance. Why don’t you break him in?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 156\\nNino had to take a big drink when he was al one with Deanna Dunn. He was trying to be \\nnonchalant but it was hard. Deanna Dunn h ad the upturned nose, the clean-cut classical \\nfeatures of the Anglo- Saxon beauty. And he knew her so well. He had seen  her alone in \\na bedroom, heartbroken, weeping over her  dead flier husband w ho had left her with \\nfatherless children. He had seen her angry,  hurt, humiliated, yet with a shining dignity \\nwhen a caddish Clark Gable had taken advantage of her, then left her for a sexpot. \\n(Deanna Dunn never played sexpots in the movies.) He had seen her flushed with \\nrequited love, writhing in the embrace of the man s he adored and he had seen her die \\nbeautifully at least a half dozen times. He had seen her and hear d her and dreamed \\nabout her and yet he was not prepared for the first thing she said to him alone. \\n“Johnny is one of the few men with  balls in this town,” she said. “The rest are all fags \\nand sick morons who couldn’t get it up with a broad if  you pumped a truckload of \\nSpanish fly into their scrotum s.” She took Nino by the hand and led him into a corner of \\nthe room, out of traffic and out of competition. \\nThen still coolly charming, she asked him about himself. He saw through her. He saw \\nthat she was playing the role of the rich soci ety girl who is being kind to the stableboy or \\nthe chauffeur, but who in the movie would either discourage his amatory interest (if the \\npart were played by Spencer Tracy), or thro w up everything in her mad desire for him (if \\nthe part were played by Clark Gable). But it  didn’t matter. He found himself telling her \\nabout how he and Johnny had grown up t ogether in New York, about how he and \\nJohnny had sung together on little club date s. He found her marvelously sympathetic \\nand interested. Once she asked casually, “Do you know how Johnny made that bastard Jack Woltz give him the part?” Nino froze and shook his head. She didn’t pursue it. \\nThe time had come to see the preview of  a new Woltz movie. Deanna Dunn led Nino, \\nher warm hand imprisoning  his, to an interior room of the mansion that  had no windows \\nbut was furnished with about fifty small two- person couches scattered around in such a \\nway as to give each one a little island of semiprivacy. \\nNino saw there was a small t able beside the couch and on the table were an ice bowl, \\nglasses and bottles of liquor pl us a tray of cigarettes. He gave Deanna Dunn a cigarette, \\nlit it and then mixed them bot h drinks. They didn’t speak to each other. After a few \\nminutes the lights went out. \\nHe had been expecting something outrageous. A fter all, he had heard the legends of \\nHollywood depravity. But he was not quite  prepared for Deanna Dunn’s voracious  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 157\\nplummet on his sexual organ without even a c ourteous and friendly word of preparation. \\nHe kept sipping his drink and watching the movie, but not tasting, not seeing. He was \\nexcited in a way he had never  been before but part of it  was because this woman \\nservicing him in the dark had been t he object of his adolescent dreams. \\nYet in a way his masculinit y was insulted. So when the world-famous Deanna Dunn was \\nsated and had tidied him up, he very coolly fixed her a fr esh drink in the darkness and lit \\nher a fresh cigarette and said in the most relaxed voice imaginable, “This looks like a \\npretty good movie.” \\nHe felt her stiffen beside him on  the couch. Could it be she was waiting for some sort of \\ncompliment? Nino poured his glass full from  the nearest bottle his hand touched in the \\ndarkness. The hell with that. She’d treated him like a goddamn male whore. For some \\nreason now he felt a cold a nger at all these women. Th ey watched the picture for \\nanother fifteen minutes. He leaned away from her so their bodies did not touch. \\nFinally she said in a low harsh whisper, “Don’t be such a snotty punk, you liked it. You \\nwere as big as a house.” \\nNino sipped his drink and said in his natural off-hand manner, “That’s the way it always \\nis. You should see it when I get excited.” \\nShe laughed a little and kept quiet  for the rest of the picture.  Finally it was over and the \\nlights went on. Nino took a look around. He  could see there had been a ball here in the \\ndarkness though oddly enough he hadn’t heard a thing. But so me of the dames had that \\nhard, shiny, brighteyed look of women w ho had just been worked over real good. They \\nsauntered out of the projection room. Deanna Dunn left him immediately to go over and talk to an older man Nino recognized as a fa mous featured player, only now, seeing the \\nguy in person, he realized that he was a fag. He sipped his drink thoughtfully. \\nJohnny Fontane came up beside him and said, “Hi, old buddy, having a good time?” \\nNino grinned. “I don’t know. It’s different. Now when I go back to the old neighborhood I \\ncan say Deanna Dunn had me.” \\nJohnny laughed. “She can be better than that  if she-invites you home with her. Did \\nshe?” \\nNino shook his head. “I got too interested in the movie,” he said. But this time Johnny \\ndidn’t laugh. \\n“Get serious, kid,” he said. “A dame like that  cn do you a lot of good. And you used to  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 158\\nboff anything. Man, sometimes I still get nigh tmares when I remember those ugly broads \\nyou used to bang.” \\nNino waved his glass drunkenly and said very loud, “Yeah, they were ugly but they were \\nwomen.” Deanna Dunn, in the corner, turned her  head to look at them. Nino waved his \\nglass at her in greeting. \\nJohnny Fontane sighed. “OK, you’ re just a guinea peasant.” \\n“And I ain’t gonna change,” Nino said with his charmingly drunken smile. \\nJohnny understood him perfectly. He knew Nino was not as drunk as he pretended. He \\nknew that Nino was only pretending so that he could say th ings which he felt were too \\nrude to say to his new Hollywood padron e when sober. He put his arm around Nino’s \\nneck and said affectionately, “You wise guy bum , you know you got an ironclad contract \\nfor a year and you can say and do anything you want and I can’t fire you.” \\n“You can’t fire me?” Nino said with drunken cunning. \\n“No,” Johnny said. \\n“Then fuck you,” Nino said. \\nFor a moment Johnny was surprised into anger. He saw the careless grin on Nino’s \\nface. But in the past few years he must have gotten smarter, or his own descent from \\nstardom had made him more sensitive. In that moment he under stood Nino, why his \\nboyhood singing partner had never become succe ssful, why he was trying to destroy \\nany chance of success now. That Nino was reacti ng away from all the prices of success, \\nthat in some way he felt insulted by everything that was being done for him. \\nJohnny took Nino by the arm and led him out of  the house. Nino could barely walk now. \\nJohnny was talking to him soothingly. “OK, kid, you just sing for me, I wants make \\ndough on you. I won’t try to run your life. You do whatever you wants do. OK, paisan? \\nAll you gotta do is sing for me and earn me  money now that I can’t sing anymore. You \\ngot that, old buddy?” \\nNino straightened up. “I’ll sing for you, Johnny,” he said, his voice slurring so that he \\ncould barely be understood. “I’m a better singer than you now. I was always a better \\nsinger than you, you know that?” \\nJohnny stood there thinking; so  that was it. He knew that  when his voice was healthy \\nNino simply wasn’t in the same league with him, never had been in t hose years they had \\nsung together as kids. He saw Nino was waiting for an answer,  weaving drunkenly in the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 159\\nCalifornia moonlight. “Fuck you,” he said ge ntly, and they both laughed together like the \\nold days when they had both been equally young. \\n* * *  \\nWhen Johnny Fontane got word about the shooting of Don Corleone he not only worried \\nabout his Godfather, but also wondered whether the financing for his movie was still \\nalive. He had wanted to go to New York to  pay his respects to his Godfather in the \\nhospital but he had been told not to get any bad publicity, that was the last thing Don \\nCorleone would want. So he wa ited. A week later a mess enger came from Tom Hagen. \\nThe financing was still on but fo r only one picture at a time. \\nMeanwhile Johnny let Nino go his own way in Hollywood and  California, and Nino was \\ndoing all right with the young starlets. Sometimes Johnny called him up for a night out \\ntogether but never leaned on him.  When they talked about th e Don getting shot, Nino \\nsaid to Johnny, “You know, once I asked the Don for a job in his organization and he wouldn’t give it to me. I was tired of driving a truck and I wanted to make a lot of dough. \\nYou know what he told me? He says ever y man has only one des tiny and that my \\ndestiny was to be an artist. Meaning that I couldn’t be a racket guy.” \\nJohnny thought that one over. The Godfather must be just about  the smartest guy in the \\nworld. He’d known immediatel y that Nino could never make a racket guy, would only get \\nhimself in trouble or get killed. Get killed with  just one of his wisecracks. But how did the \\nDon know that he would be an  artist? Because, goddamn i t, he figured that someday I’d \\nhelp Nino. And how did he figur e that? Because he would dr op the word to me and I \\nwould try to show my gratitude.  Of course he never asked me to do it. He just let me \\nknow it would make him happy if I did it. Johnny Fo ntane sighed. No w the Godfather \\nwas hurt, in trouble, and he could kiss the Academy Award good-bye with Woltz working \\nagainst him and no help on his side. Only the Do n had the personal contacts that could \\napply pressure and the Corleone Family had other things to think about. Johnny had \\noffered to help, Hagen had given him a curt no. \\nJohnny was busy getting his own picture going. The author of the book he had starred in \\nhad finished his new novel and came west on J ohnny’s invitation, to talk it over without \\nagents or studios getting into the act. The se cond book was perfect for what Johnny \\nwanted. He wouldn’t have to sing, it had a good gutsy story with plenty of dames and \\nsex and it had a part that Johnny instant ly recognized as tailor-made for Nino. The \\ncharacter talked like Nino, acted like him, ev en looked like him. It was uncanny. All Nino  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 160\\nwould have to do would be to get up on the screen and be himself. \\nJohnny worked fast. He found that he knew a lot more about production than he thought \\nhe did, but he hired an executive producer, a man who knew his stuff but had trouble \\nfinding work because of the bl acklist. Johnny didn’t take adv antage but gave the man a \\nfair contract. “I expect you to save me more dough this way,” he told the man frankly. \\nSo he was surprised when the executive produc er came to him and told him the union \\nrep had to be taken care of to  the tune of fifty thousand dol lars. There were a lot of \\nproblems dealing with overtime and hiring and the fifty thousand dollars would be well \\nspent. Johnny debated whether the executiv e producer was hustling him and then said, \\n“Send the union guy to me.” \\nThe union guy was Billy Goff. Johnny said to him, “I thought the union  stuff was fixed by \\nmy friends. I was told not to worry about it. At all.” \\nGoff said, “Who told you that?” \\nJohnny said, “You know goddamn well who told me. I won’t say his name but if he tells \\nme something that’s it.” \\nGoff said, “Things have changed. Your friend is  in trouble and his word don’t go this far \\nwest anymore.” \\nJohnny shrugged. “See me in a couple of days. OK?” \\nGoff smiled. “Sure, Johnny,” he said. “But ca lling in New York ain’t going to help you.” \\nBut calling New York did help. Johnny spoke to Hagen at his office. Hagen told him bluntly not to pay. “Your Godfather will be sore as hell if you pay that bastard a dime,” \\nhe told Johnny. “It will make the Don lose re spect and right now he can’t afford that.” \\n“Can I talk to the Don?” Johnny asked. “Will you talk to him? I gotta get the picture \\nrolling.” \\n“Nobody can talk to the Don right now,” Hagen said. “He’s too sick. I’ll talk to Sonny \\nabout fixing things up. But I’ll make the decis ion on this. Don’t pay that smart bastard a \\ndime. If anything changes, I’ll let you know.” \\nAnnoyed, Johnny hung up. Union trouble coul d add a fortune to making the film and \\nscrew up the works generally. For a moment he debated slipping Goff the fifty grand on \\nthe quiet. After all, the Don telling him so mething and Hagen telling him something and \\ngiving him orders were two different thi ngs. But he decided to wait for a few days.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 161\\nBy waiting he saved fifty thousand dollars. Tw o nights later, Goff was found shot to \\ndeath in his home in Glendale. There was no more talk of union trouble. Johnny was a \\nlittle shaken by the killing. It was the first time the long arm of the Don had struck such a \\nlethal blow so close to him. \\nAs the weeks went by and he became busie r and busier with getting the script ready, \\ncasting the movie and working out producti on details, Johnny Font ane forgot about his \\nvoice, his not being able to sing. Yet when the Academy Award nominations came out and he found himself one of the candidates , he was depressed because he was not \\nasked to sing one of the songs nominated for the Oscar at the ceremony that would be \\ntelevised nationally. But he shrugged it off and kept working. He had no hope of winning the Academy Award now that his Godfather was no longer abl e to put pressure on, but \\ngetting the nomination had some value. \\nThe record he and Nino had cut, the one of Itali an songs, was selling much better than \\nanything he had cut lately, but he knew that  it was Nino’s success more than his. He \\nresigned himself to never being ab le to again sing professionally. \\nOnce a week he had dinner with Ginny and the kids. No matter how hectic things got he never skipped that duty. But he didn’t sleep with Ginny. M eanwhile his second wife had \\nfinagled a Mexican divorce and so he was a bachelor again. Oddly enough he was not \\nthat frantic to bang starlets who would have been easy meat. He was too snobbish \\nreally. He was hurt that none of the young st ars, the actresses who were still on top, \\never gave him a tumble. But it was good to  work hard. Most nights he would go home \\nalone, put his old records on t he player, have a drink and hum  along with them for a few \\nbars. He had been good,  damn good. He hadn’t realized  how good he was. Even aside \\nfrom the special voice, which could have happened to any body, he was good. He had \\nbeen a real artist and never knew  it, and never knew how mu ch he loved it. He’d ruined \\nhis voice with booze and tobacco and broads ju st when he really knew what it was all \\nabout. \\nSometimes Nino came over for a drink and  listened with him and Johnny would say to \\nhim scornfully, “You guinea bastard, you never sang like that in yo ur life.” And Nino \\nwould give him that curiously charming smil e and shake his head and say, “No, and I \\nnever will,” in a sympathetic  voice, as if he knew what Johnny was thinking. \\nFinally, a week before shooting the new picture, the Academy Award night rolled \\naround. Johnny invited Nino to come along but Nino refused. Johnny said, “Buddy, I  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 162\\nnever asked you a favor, right? Do me a favor tonight and come with me. You’re the \\nonly guy who’ll really feel sorry for me if I don’t win.” \\nFor one moment Nino looked startled. Then he sa id, “Sure, old buddy, I can make it.” He \\npaused for a moment and said, “if you don’t win, fo rget it. Just get as drunk as you can \\nget and I’ll take care of you. Hell, I won’t even drink myself tonight. How about that for \\nbeing a buddy?” \\n“Man,” Johnny Fontane said, “that’s some buddy.” \\nThe Academy Award night came and Nino kept  his promise. He came to Johnny’s \\nhouse dead sober and they left for the pres entation theater toget her. Nino wondered \\nwhy Johnny hadn’t invited any of his girls or his ex-wives to the Award dinner. Especially \\nGinny. Didn’t he think Ginny would root for him? Nino wished he could have just one \\ndrink, it looked like a long bad night. \\nNino Valenti found the whole Academy Award affair a bore until the winner of the best \\nmale actor was announced. When he heard the words “Johnny Fontane,” he found \\nhimself jumping into the air and applauding.  Johnny reached out a hand for him to shake \\nand Nino shook it. He knew his buddy nee ded human contact with someone he trusted \\nand Nino felt an enormous sadness that J ohnny didn’t have anyone better than himself \\nto touch in his moment of glory. \\nWhat followed was an absolute nightmare. Ja ck Woltz’s picture had swept all the major \\nawards and so the studio’s party was swamped with newspaper people and all the \\non-the-make hustlers; male and female. Nino  kept his promise to remain sober, and he \\ntried to watch over Johnny. But the women of  the party kept pulling Johnny Fontane into \\nbedrooms for a little chat and Johnny kept getting drunker and drunker. \\nMeanwhile the woman who had  won the award for the bes t actress was suffering the \\nsame fate but loving it more and handling it  better. Nino turned her down, the only man \\nat the party to do so. \\nFinally somebody had a great idea. The public mating of  the two winners, everybody \\nelse at the party to be spectators in the stands. The actress was stripped down and the \\nother women started to undre ss Johnny Fontane. It was then that Nino, the only sober \\nperson there, grabbed the hal f-clothed Johnny and slung him over his shoulder and \\nfought his way out of the house and to th eir car. As he drove Johnny home, Nino \\nthought that if that was success, he didn’t want it. \\n  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 163\\nBook Three \\nChapter 14 \\nThe Don was a real man at the age of twelve . Short, dark, slender, living in the strange \\nMoorish-looking village of Corleone in Sicily, he had been born Vito Andolini, but when \\nstrange men came to kill the son of the m an they had murdered, his mother sent the \\nyoung boy to America to stay with friends. A nd in the new land he  changed his name to \\nCorleone to preserve some tie with his native  village. It was one of the few gestures of \\nsentiment he was ever to make. \\nIn Sicily at the turn of the century t he Mafia was the second government, far more \\npowerful than the official one in Rome. Vito Corleone’s father became involved in a feud \\nwith another villager who took hi s case to the Mafia. The father refused to knuckle under \\nand in a public quarrel killed the local Mafi a chief. A week later he himself was found \\ndead, his body torn apart by lupara blasts. A month after the funeral Mafia gunmen \\ncame inquiring after the young boy, Vito. They  had decided that he was too close to \\nmanhood, that he might try, to avenge the death of his father in the years to come. The \\ntwelve-year-old Vito was hidden by relati ves and shipped to America. There he was \\nboarded with the Abbandandos, whose son Genco was later to become Consigliere to \\nhis Don. \\nYoung Vito went to work in the Abbandando grocery store on Ninth Avenue in New \\nYork’s Hell’s Kitchen. At the age of eighteen Vi to married an Italian girl freshly arrived \\nfrom Sicily, a girl of only sixteen but a sk illed cook, a good housewife. They settled down \\nin a tenement on Tenth Avenue, near 35th Str eet, only a few blocks from where Vito \\nworked, and two years later were blessed with t heir first child, Santino, called by all his \\nfriends Sonny because of his devotion to his father. \\nIn the neighborhood lived a ma n called Fanucci. He was a heavy-set, fierce-looking \\nItalian who wore expensive light-colored suits and a cream-colored fedora. This man \\nwas reputed to be of the “Black Hand,” an offshoot of the Mafia which extorted money \\nfrom families and storekeepers by  threat of physical violence . However, since most of \\nthe inhabitants of the neighbor hood were violent themselves, Fanucci’s threats of bodily \\nharm were effective only with elderly coup les without male children to defend them. \\nSome of the storekeepers paid him trifling sums as a matter of convenience. However, \\nFanucci was also a scavenger on fellow crim inals, people who illegally sold Italian \\nlottery or ran gambling games in their homes. The Abbandando grocery gave him a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 164\\nsmall tribute, this despite the protests of  young Genco, who told his father he would \\nsettle the Fanucci hash. His father forbade hi m. Vito Corleone observed all this without \\nfeeling in any way involved. \\nOne day Fanucci was set upon by three young m en who cut his throat from ear to ear, \\nnot deeply enough to kill him,  but enough to frighten him and make him bleed a great \\ndeal. Vito saw Fanucci fleeing from his punisher s, the circular slas h flowing red. What \\nhe never forgot was Fanucci holding the cr eam-colored fedora under his chin to catch \\nthe dripping blood as he ran. As  if he did not want his suit soiled or did not want to leave \\na shameful trail of carmine. \\nBut this attack proved a blessing in disguise for Fanucci. The three young men were not \\nmurderers, merely tough yo ung boys determined to teach him a lesson and stop him \\nfrom scavenging. Fannucci proved himsel f a murderer. A few weeks later the \\nknife-wielder was shot to death and the fam ilies of the other two young men paid an \\nindemnity to Fanucci to make him forswear his vengeance. After that the tributes \\nbecame higher and Fanucci became a partner in the neighborhood gambling games. As \\nfor Vito Corleone, it was none of his affa ir. He forgot about it immediately. \\nDuring World War I, when imported olive oil became scarce, Fanucci acquired a \\npart-interest in the Abbandando grocery stor e by supplying it not only with oil, but \\nimported Italian salami, hams an d cheeses. He then moved a nephew into the store and \\nVito Corleone found hims elf out of a job. \\nBy this time, the second child, Frederioo,  had arrived and Vito Corleone had four \\nmouths to feed. Up to this time he had been a quiet, very contained young man who \\nkept his thoughts to himself. The son of  the grocery store owner, young Genco \\nAbbandando, was his closest fr iend, and to the surprise  of both of them, Vito \\nreproached his friend for his father’s deed. Genco, flushed wi th shame, vowed to Vito \\nthat he would not have to worry  about food. That he, Genco,  would steal food from the \\ngrocery to supply his friend’s needs. This offe r though was sternly refused by Vito as too \\nshameful, a son stealing from his father. \\nThe young Vito, however, felt a cold ange r for the dreaded Fanucci. He never showed \\nthis anger in any way but bided his time. He  worked in the railroad for a few months and \\nthen, when the war ended, wo rk became slow and he could earn only a few days’ pay a \\nmonth. Also, most of the foremen were Irish and American and a bused the workmen in \\nthe foulest language, which Vito always bore stone-faced as if he did not comprehend,  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 165\\nthough he understood English very well despite his accent. \\nOne evening as Vito was hav ing supper with his family there was a knock on the \\nwindow that led to the open sir shaft that separated them from the next building. When \\nVito pulled aside the curtain he saw to his astonishment one of the young men in the \\nneighborhood, Peter Clemenza, leaning out from a window on the other side of the air \\nshaft. He was extending a white-sheeted bundle. \\n“Hey, paisan,” Clemenza said. “Hold these for me until I ask for them. Hurry up.” \\nAutomatically Vito reached over the empty space of the air shaft and took the bundle. \\nClemenza’s face was strained and urgent. He wa s in some sort of trouble and Vito’s \\nhelping action was instinctive.  But when he untied the bundle in his kitchen, there were \\nfive oily guns staining the wh ite cloth. He put them in his bedroom closet and waited. He \\nlearned that Clemenza had been taken away by the police. They must have been \\nknocking on his door when he handed the guns over the air shaft. \\nVito never said a word to any one and of course his terrified wife dared not open her lips \\neven in gossip for fear her own husband would be sent to prison. Two days later Peter \\nClemenza reappeared in the neighborhood and asked Vito casually, “Do you have my \\ngoods still?” \\nVito nodded. He was in the habit of talking li ttle. Clemenza came up to his tenement flat \\nand was given a glass of wine while Vito dug the bundle out of his bedroom closet. \\nClemenza drank his wine, his heavy good-natured face alertl y watching Vito. “Did you \\nlook inside?” \\nVito, his face impassive, shook his head. “I’m not interested in things that don’t concern \\nme,” he said. \\nThey drank wine together the rest of t he evening. They found each other congenial. \\nClemenza was a storyteller; Vito Corleone wa s a listener to storytellers. They became \\ncasual friends. \\nA few days later Clemenza asked the wife of Vito Corleone if she would like a fine rug \\nfor her living room floor. He took Vito with him to help carry the rug. \\nClemenza led Vito to an apar tment house with two marble p illars and a white marble \\nstoop. He used a key to open the door and t hey were inside a plush apartment. \\nClemenza grunted, “Go on the other side of the room a nd help me roll it up.” \\nThe rug was a rich red wool. Vito Corleone was astonis hed by Clemenza’s generosity.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 166\\nTogether they rolled the rug in to a pile and Clemenza took one end while Vito took the \\nother. They lifted it and start ed carrying it toward the door. \\nAt that moment the apartm ent bell rang. Clemenza imm ediately dropped the rug and \\nstrode to the window. He pulled the drape as ide slightly and w hat he saw made him \\ndraw a gun from inside his jacket. It was only at that moment the astonished Vito \\nCorleone realized that they were stealing the rug from some stranger’s apartment. \\nThe apartment bell rang again. Vito went up al ongside Clemenza so that he too could \\nsee what was happening. At’ t he door was a uniformed policem an. As they watched, the \\npoliceman gave the doorbell a final push,  then shrugged and walked away down the \\nmarble steps and down the street. \\nClemenza grunted in a satisfi ed way and said, “Come on, let’s go.” He picked up his end \\nof the rug and Vito picked up the other end.  The policeman had barely turned the corner \\nbefore they were edging out the heavy oaken door and into the street with the rug \\nbetween them. Thirty minutes later they were  cutting the rug to fit the living rooms of \\nVito Corleone’s apartment. They had enough left over for the bedroom. Clemenza was \\nan expert workman and from the pockets of his wide, ill-fitting jacket (even then he liked \\nto wear loose clothes though he was not so fat), he had the necessary carpet-cutting \\ntools. \\nTime went on, things did not  improve. The Corleone family  could not eat the beautiful \\nrug. Very well, there was no work, his wif e and children must starve. Vito took some \\nparcels of food from his friend Genco wh ile he thought things out. Finally he was \\napproached by Clemenza and Te ssio, another young tough of  the neighb orhood. They \\nwere men who thought well of  him, the way he carried himself, and they knew he was \\ndesperate. They proposed to him that he bec ome one of their gang which specialized in \\nhijacking trucks of silk dresses after those trucks were loaded up at the factory on 31st \\nStreet. There was no risk. The truck drivers were sensible workingmen who at the sight \\nof a gun flopped on the sidewa lk like angels while the hijacke rs drove the truck away to \\nbe unloaded at a friend’s warehouse. Some of the merchandise would be sold to an \\nItalian wholesaler, part of t he loot would be sold d oor-to-door in the Italian \\nneighborhoods– Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, Mulberry Street, and the Chelsea district in \\nManhattan– all to poor Italian families look ing for a bargain, whose daughters could \\nnever be able to afford such fine apparel . Clemenza and Tessio ne eded Vito to drive \\nsince they knew he chauffeured the Abbandando grocery store delivery truck. In 1919, \\nskilled automobile drivers were at a premium.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 167\\nAgainst his better judgment, Vito Corleone a ccepted their offer. The clinching argument \\nwas that he would clear at least a thousand dol lars for his share of the job. But his \\nyoung companions struck him as rash, the planning of the job haphazard, the \\ndistribution of the loot foolhardy. Their w hole approach was too careless for his taste. \\nBut he thought them of good, so und character. Peter Clemenza,  already burly, inspired \\na certain trust, and the lean saturnine Tessio inspired confidence. \\nThe job itself went off without a hitch. Vito Corleone felt no fear, much to his \\nastonishment, when his two comrades flashed guns and made the driv er get out of the \\nsilk truck. He was also impressed with the coolness of  Clemenza and Tessio. They \\ndidn’t get excited but joked with the driver, told him if he was a good lad they’d send his \\nwife a few dresses. Because Vito thought it  stupid to peddle dresses himself and so \\ngave his whole share of stock to the f ence, he made only seven hundred dollars. But \\nthis was a considerable sum of money in 1919. \\nThe next day on the str eet, Vito Corleoue was st opped by the cream-suited, \\nwhite-fedoraed Fanucci. Fanucci was a brutal -looking man and he had done nothing to \\ndisguise the circular scar that stretched in a white semicircle from ear to ear, looping \\nunder his chin. He had heavy black brows and c oarse features whic h, when he smiled, \\nwere in some odd way amiable. \\nHe spoke with a very thick Sicilian accent. “A h, young fellow,” he said to Vito. “People \\ntell me you’re rich. You and your two friend s. But don’t you think you’ve treated me a \\nlittle shabbily? After all, this is my nei ghborhood and yon s hould let me wet my beak.” \\nHe used the Sicilian phrase of the Mafia, “Fari vagnari a pizzu.” Pizzu means the beak \\nof any small bird such as a canary. The phrase itself was a demand for part of the loot. \\nAs was his habit, Vito Corleone did not answer. He understood the implication \\nimmediately and was waitin g for a definite demand. \\nFanucci smiled at him, showing gold teet h and stretching his nooses-like scar tight \\naround his face. He mopped his face with a handkerchief and unbuttoned his jacket for \\na moment as if to cool himself but really  to show the gun he carried stuck in the \\nwaistband of his comfortabl y wide trousers. Then he sighed  and said, “Give me five \\nhundred dollars and I’ll forget the insult. After all, young people don’t know the courtesies due a man like myself.” \\nVito Corleone smiled at him and even as  a young man still unblooded, there was \\nsomething so chilling in hi s smile that Fanucci hesitated a moment before going on.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 168\\n“Otherwise the police will come  to see you, your wife and children will be shamed and \\ndestitute. Of course if my inform ation as to your gains is in correct I’ll dip my beak just a \\nlittle. But no less than three hundred dolla rs. And don’t try to deceive me.” \\nFor the first time Vito Corleone spoke. His  voice was reasonable, showed no anger. It \\nwas courteous, as befitted a young man s peaking to an older man of Fanucci’s \\neminence. He said softly, “My two friend have my share of the money, rll have to speak \\nto them.” \\nFanucci was reassured. “You can tell your two friends that I expect them to let me wet \\nmy beak in the same manner. Don’t be afra id to tell them,” he added reassuringly. \\n“Clemenza and I know each other well, he under stands these things. Let yourself be \\nguided by him. He has more experience in these matters.” \\nVito Corleone shrugged. He tri ed to look a little embarrassed.  “Of course,” he said. “You \\nunderstand this is all new to me. Thank you for speaking to me as a godfather.” \\nFanucci was impressed. “You’re a good fe llow,” he said. He took Vito’s hand and \\nclasped it in both of his hairy ones. “You hav e respect,” he said. “A fine thing in the \\nyoung. Next time speak to me first, eh? Perhaps I can he lp you in your plans.” \\nIn later years Vito Corleone understood that what had made him act in such a perfect, \\ntactical way with Fanucci was the death of his own hot-tempered father who had been \\nkilled by the Mafia in Sicily. Bu t at that time all he felt was an icy rage that this man \\nplanned to rob him of the money he had risk ed his life and freedom to earn. He had not \\nbeen afraid. Indeed he thought, at that moment, that Fanucci was a crazy fool. From \\nwhat he had seen of Clemenza, that burly Sicilian would sooner give up his life than a \\npenny of his loot. After all, Clemenza had been ready to kill a policeman merely to steal \\na rug. And the slender Tessio had the deadly air of a viper. \\nBut later that night, in Clemenza’s tenement apartment across the air shaft, Vito Corleone received another lesson in th e education he had just begun. Clemenza \\ncursed, Tessio scowled, but then both men st arted talking about w hether Fanucci would \\nbe satisfied with two hundred dollars. Tessio thought he might. \\nClemenza was positive. “No, that scarface bastard must hav e found out what we made \\nfrom the wholesaler who bought  the dresses. Fanucci won’t take a dime less than three \\nhundred dollars. We’ll have to pay.” \\nVito was astonished but was careful not to s how his astonishment. “W hy do we have to \\npay him? What can he do to the three of us? We’re str onger than him. We have guns.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 169\\nWhy do we have to hand over the money we earned?” \\nClemenza explained patiently. “F anucci has friends, real brutes. He has connections \\nwith the police. He’d like us to tell him our plans because he could set us up for the gyps \\nand earn their gratitude. Then th ey would owe him a favor. That’s how he operates. And \\nhe has a license from Maranzalla himself to  work this neighborhood.” Maranzalla was a \\ngangster often in the newspapers,  reputed to be the leader of a criminal ring specializing \\nin extortion, gambling and armed robbery. \\nClemenza served wine that he had made himself. His wife,  after putting a plate of \\nsalami, olives and a loaf of Italian bread on the table, went down to sit with her women \\ncronies in front of the build ing, carrying her chair with her. She was a young Italian girl \\nonly a few years in the country and did not yet understand English. \\nVito Corleone sat with his two friends  and drank wine. He had never used his \\nintelligence before as he was using it now. He was surpris ed at how clearly he could \\nthink. He recalled everythi ng he knew about Fanucci. He remembered the day the man \\nhad had his throat cut and had r un down the street holding hi s fedora under his chin to \\ncatch the dripping blood. He remembered t he murder of the man who had wield the \\nknife and the other two having their sentences removed by paying an indemnity. And \\nsuddenly he was sure that Fanucci had no gr eat connections, could not possibly have. \\nNot a man who informed to the police. Not a man who allowed his vengeance to be bought off. A real Mafioso chief would have  had the other two m en killed also. No. \\nFanucci had got lucky and killed one man but had known he could not kill the other two \\nafter they were alerted. And so he had allowed himself to  be paid. It was the personal \\nbrutal force of the man that allowed him to  levy tribute on the shop keepers, the gambling \\ngames that ran in the tenemen t apartments. But Vito Corleone knew of at least one \\ngambling game that had never paid Fanucci tributes and nothing had ever happened to \\nthe men running it. \\nAnd so it was Fanucci alone. Or Fanucci with some gunmen hired for special jobs on a \\nstrictly cash basis. Which left Vito Corle one with another decision. The course his own \\nlife must take. \\nIt was from this experience came his oft- repeated belief that every man has but one \\ndestiny. On that night he could have paid Fanucci the tribute and have become again a \\ngrocery clerk with perhaps his own grocery stor e in the years to come. But destiny had \\ndecided that he was to become a Don and had br ought Fanucci to him to set him on his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 170\\ndestined path. \\nWhen they finished the bottle of wine, Vito sa id cautiously to Clemenza and Tessio, “If \\nyou like, why not give me two hundred dollars each to pay to Fanucci? I guarantee he \\nwill accept that amount from me. Then leave everything in my hands. I’ll settle this \\nproblem to your satisfaction.” \\nAt once Clemenza’s eyes gleamed with suspicion. Vito said to him coldly, “I never lie to \\npeople I have accepted as my friends. Speak to Fanucci yourself tomorrow. Let him ask you for the money. But don’t pay him. And don’ t in any way quarrel with him. Tell him \\nyou have to get the money and will give it to me to give  him. Let him understand that \\nyou are willing to pay what he asks. Don’t bargain. I’ll quarrel over the price with him. \\nThere’s no point making him angry with us if he’s as dangerous a man as you say he is.” \\nThey left it at that. The next day Clemenza s poke with Fanucci to make sure that Vito \\nwas not making up the story. Then Clemenza came to Vito’s apartment and gave him \\nthe two hundred dollars. He peer ed at Vito Corleone and said , “Fanucci told me nothing \\nbelow three hundred dollars, how will you make him take less?” \\nVito Corleone said reasonably, “Surely that’s no concern of yours. Just remember that \\nI’ve done you a service.” \\nTessio came later. Tessio was more reserved than Clemenza, sharper, more clever but \\nwith less force. He sensed something amiss,  something not quite right. He was a little \\nworried. He said to Vito Corl eone, “Watch yourself with t hat bastard of a Black Hand, \\nhe’s tricky as a priest. Do you want me to be here when you hand him the money, as a \\nwitness?” \\nVito Corleone shook his head. He didn’t even bother to answer. He merely said to \\nTessio, “Tell Fanucci I’ll pay hi m the money here, in my house at nine o’clo ck tonight. I’ll \\nhave to give him a glass of wine and talk, reason with him to ta ke the lesser sum.” \\nTessio shook his head. “You won’t have mu ch luck. Fanucci never retreats.” \\n“I’ll reason with him,” Vito Corleone said. It wa s to become a famous phrase in the years \\nto come. It was to become the warning rattle before a deadly strike. When he became a \\nDon and asked opponents to sit down and reason with him, they understood it was the \\nlast chance to resolve an affa ir without bloodshed and murder. \\nVito Corleone told his wife to take the tw o children, Sonny and Fredo, down into the \\nstreet after supper and on no account to let them come up to the house until he gave  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 171\\nher permission. She was to sit on guard at  the tenement door. He  had some private \\nbusiness with Fanucci that could not be interr upted. He saw the look of fear on her face \\nand was angry. He said to her  quietly, “Do you think you’ve  married a fool?” She didn’t \\nanswer. She did not answer because she was fr ightened, not of Fanucci  now, but of her \\nhusband. He was changing visibly before her eyes, hour by hour, into a man who \\nradiated some dangerous force. He had always been quiet, speaking little, but always \\ngentle, always reasonable, which was extraord inary in a young Sic ilian male. What she \\nwas seeing was the shedding of his protective  coloration of a harmless nobody now that \\nhe was ready to start on his destiny. He had started late, he was twenty-five years old, \\nbut he was to start with a flourish. \\nVito Corleone had decided to murder Fanucci . By doing so he would have an extra \\nseven hundred dollars in his bankroll. Th e three hundred dollars he himself would have \\nto pay the Black Hand terro rist and the two hundred dollars from Tessio and the two \\nhundred dollars from Clemenza. If he did not kill Fanucci, he would have to pay the man \\nseven hundred dollars cold cash. Fanucci a live was not worth seven hundred dollars to \\nhim. He would not pay seven hundred dollars to keep Fanucci  alive. If Fanucci needed \\nseven hundred dollars for an operation to save  his life, he would not give Fanucci seven \\nhundred dollars for the surgeon. He owed Fanucci no personal debt of gratitude, they \\nwere not blood relatives, he did not love Fanucci. Why, then, should he give Fanucci \\nseven hundred dollars? \\nAnd it followed inevitably, that since Fanucci wished to take seven hundred dollars from \\nhim by force, why should he not kill Fanucci ? Surely the world could do without such a \\nperson. \\nThere were of course some practical reasons. Fanucci might indeed have powerful friends who would seek vengeance. Fanucci  himself was a dangerous man, not so \\neasily killed. There were the police and the elec tric chair. But Vito Corleone had lived \\nunder a sentence of death since t he murder of his father. As a boy of twelve he had fled \\nhis executioners and crossed t he ocean into a strange land, taking a strange name. And \\nyears of quiet observation had convinced him that he had more intelligence and more \\ncourage than other men, t hough he had never had the op portunity to use that \\nintelligence and courage. \\nAnd yet he hesitated before taking the first step toward his destiny. He even packed the seven hundred dollars in a single fold of b ills and put the money in a convenient sick \\npocket of his trousers. But he  put the money in the left si de of his trousers. In the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 172\\nright-hand pocket he put the gun Clemenza had given him to use in the hijacking of the \\nsilk truck. \\nFanucci came promptly at nine in the evening. Vito Corl eone set out a jug of homemade \\nwine that Clemenza had given him. \\nFanucci put his white fedora on the table beside the jug of wine. He loosened his broad multiflowered tie, its tomato stains cam ouflaged by the bright patterns. The summer \\nnight was hot, the gaslight feeble. It was very  quiet in the apartmen t. But Vito Corleone \\nwas icy. To show his good faith he handed over the roll of bills and watched carefully as \\nFanucci, after counting it, took out a wide l eather wallet and stuffe d the money inside. \\nFanucci sipped his glass of wine and said, “You still owe me two hundred dollars.” His heavy-browed face was expressionless. \\nVito Corleone said in his cool reasonable voice,  “I’m a little short, I’ve been out of work. \\nLet me owe you the money for a few weeks.” \\nThis was a permissible gambit. Fanucci had the bulk of the money  and would wait. He \\nmight even be persuaded to take nothing more or to wait a little longer. He chuckled \\nover his wine and said, “Ah, you’re a sharp y oung fellow. How is it I’ve never noticed you \\nbefore? You’re too quiet a chap for your own interest. I coul d find some work for you to \\ndo that would be very profitable.” \\nVito Corleone showed his interest with a polite nod and filled up t he man’s glass from \\nthe purple jug. But Fanucci thought better of what he was goi ng to say and rose from his \\nchair and shook Vito’s hand. “Good night, y oung fellow,” he said. “No hard feelings, eh? \\nIf I can ever do you a service let me know. Y ou’ve done a good job for yourself tonight.” \\nVito let Fanucci go down the stairs and ou t the building. The st reet was thronged with \\nwitnesses to show that he had left the Corl eone home safely. Vito watched from the \\nwindow. He saw Fanucci turn the corner  toward 11th Avenue and knew he was headed \\ntoward his apartment, probably to put away his loot before comi ng out on the streets \\nagain. Perhaps to put away his gun. Vito  Corleone left his apartment and ran up the \\nstairs to the roof. He traveled over the square block of roofs and descended down the \\nsteps of an empty loft building fire escape t hat left him in the back yard. He kicked the \\nback door open and went through the front door. Across the street was Fanucci’s \\ntenement apartment house. \\nThe village of tenements exte nded only as far west as T enth Avenue. Eleventh Avenue \\nwas mostly warehouses and lofts rented by  firms who shipped by  New York Central  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 173\\nRailroad and wanted access to the frei ght yards that honeycombed the area from \\nEleventh Avenue to the Hudson River. Fanucc i’s apartment house was one of the few \\nleft standing in this wilderness and was occ upied mostly by bachelor trainmen, yard \\nworkers, and the cheapest prostitutes. Thes e people did not sit in the street and gossip \\nlike honest Italians, they sat in beer taverns guzzling their pay. So Vi to Corleone found it \\nan easy matter to slip across the deserted El eventh Avenue and into the vestibule of \\nFanucci’s apartment house. Th ere he drew the gun he had nev er fired and waited for \\nFanucci. \\nHe watched through the glass door of the ve stibule, knowing Fanu cci would come down \\nfrom Tenth Avenue. Clemenz a had showed him the safety on the gun and he had \\ntriggered it empty. But as a young boy in Sicily  at the early age of nine, he had often \\ngone hunting with’his father, had often fir ed the heavy shotgun called the lupara. It was \\nhis skill with the lupara even as a small boy  that had brought the sentence of death upon \\nhim by his father’s murderers. \\nNow waiting in the darkened ha llway, he saw the white blob  of Fanucci crossing the \\nstreet toward the doorway. Vito stepped back, shoulders pressed against the inner door \\nthat led to the stairs. He held his gun out to fire. His extended hand was only two paces \\nfrom the outside door. The door swung in. Fanucci, white, broad, smelly, filled the \\nsquare of light. Vito Corleone fired. \\nThe opened door let some of th e sound escape into the str eet, the rest of the gun’s \\nexplosion shook the building. Fanucci was holding on to the si des of the door, trying to \\nstand erect, trying to reach for his gun. The forc e of his struggle had torn the buttons off \\nhis jacket and made it swing lo ose. His gun was exposed but so was a spidery vein of \\nred on the white shirtfront  of his stomach. Very carefully , as if he were plunging a needle \\ninto a vein, Vito Corleone fired hi s second bullet into that red web. \\nFanucci fell to his knees, propping the door  open. He let out a te rrible groan, the groan \\nof a man in great physical distress that wa s almost comical. He kept giving these \\ngroans; Vito remembered hearing at least th ree of them before he put the gun against \\nFanucci’s sweaty, suety cheek and fired into his brain. No more than five seconds had \\npassed when Fanucci slumped into death,  jamming the door open with his body. \\nVery carefully Vito took the wide wallet  out of the dead man’s jacket pocket and put it \\ninside his shirt. Then he walked across the street into the loft building, through that into \\nthe yard and climbed the fire  escape to the roof. From there he surveyed the street.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 174\\nFanucci’s body was still lyi ng in the doorway but there was no sign of any other person. \\nTwo windows had gone up in the tenement and he could see dark heads poked out but \\nsince he could not see their features they had certainly not seen his. And such men \\nwould not give information to the police. Fanucci might lie there until dawn or until a \\npatrolman making the rounds stumbled on hi s body. No person in that house would \\ndeliberately expose himself to police suspic ion or questioning. They would lock their \\ndoors and pretend they had heard nothing. \\nHe could take his time. He traveled over the rooftops to his own roof door and down to \\nhis own flat. He unlocked the door, went inside and then locked the door behind him. He \\nrifled the dead man’s wallet. Besides the se ven hundred dollars he had given Fanucci \\nthere were only some singles  and a five-dollar note. \\nTucked inside the flap was an old five-dolla r gold piece, probably a luck token. If \\nFanucci was a rich gangster, he certainly di d not carry his wealth with him. This \\nconfirmed some of Vito’s suspicions. \\nHe knew he had to get rid of the wallet  and the gun (knowing enough even then that he \\nmust leave the gold piece in the wallet). He went up on the roof again and traveled over \\na few ledges. He threw the wallet down one air shaft and then he emptied the gun of \\nbullets and smashed its barrel against the roof ledge. The barrel wouldn’t break. He \\nreversed it in his hand and smashed the butt against the side of a chimney. The butt \\nsplit into two halves. He smashed it again and the pistol broke into barrel and handle, \\ntwo separate pieces. He used a separate ai r shaft for each. They made no sound when \\nthey struck the earth five stories below, but  sank into the soft hill of garbage that had \\naccumulated there. In the morning more garbage would be thrown out of the windows \\nand, with luck, would cover everythi ng. Vito returned to his apartment. \\nHe was trembling a little but was absolutel y under control. He changed his clothes and \\nfearful that some blood might have splatter ed on them, he threw them into a metal tub \\nhis wife used for washing. He took lye and heavy brown laundry soap to soak the \\nclothes and scrubbed them wit h the metal wash board beneath the sink. Then he \\nscoured tub and sink with lye an d soap. He found a bundle of newly washed clothes in \\nthe corner of the bedroom and mingled his ow n clothes with these. Then he put on a \\nfresh shirt and trousers and went down to jo in his wife and child ren and neighbors in \\nfront of the tenement. \\nAll these precautions proved to be unnecessary . The police, after discovering the dead  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 175\\nbody at dawn, never questioned Vito Corle one. Indeed he was ast onished that they \\nnever learned about Fanucci’s visit to his home on the nigh t he was shot to death. He \\nhad counted on that for an alibi, Fanucci le aving the tenement alive. He only learned \\nlater that the police had been delighted with the murder of Fanucci  and not too anxious \\nto pursue his killers. They had assumed it was another gang execution, and had \\nquestioned hoodlums with records in the racket s and a history of st rongarm. Since Vito \\nhad never been in trouble he never came into the picture. \\nBut if he had outwitted the pol ice, his partners were another matter. Pete Clemenza and \\nTessio avoided him for the next week, for the next two weeks, then t hey came to call on \\nhim one evening. They came with obvious respect. Vito Corleone greeted them with \\nimpassive courtesy and served them wine. \\nClemenza spoke first. He said softly, “N obody is collecting from the store owners on \\nNinth Avenue. Nobody is collecting from  the card games and gambling in the \\nneighborhood.” \\nVito Corleone gazed at both m en steadily but did not reply.  Tessio spoke. “We could \\ntake over Fanucci’s customers. They would pay us.” \\nVito Corleone shrugged. “Why come to m e? I have no interest in such things.” \\nClemenza laughed. Even in his y outh, before growin g his enormous belly, he had a fat \\nman’s laugh. He said now to Vito Corleone,  “How about that gun I gave you for the truck \\njob? Since you won’t need it any more  you can give it back to me.” \\nVery slowly and deliberately Vi to Corleone took a wad of bill s out of his side pocket and \\npeeled off five tens. “Here, I’ll pay you. I threw the gun away after the truck job.” He \\nsmiled at the two men. \\nAt that time Vito Corleone did not know the effect of this smile. It was chilling because it \\nattempted no menace. He smiled as if it was some private joke only he himself could \\nappreciate. But since he smiled in that fashion only in affairs that were lethal, and since the joke was not really private and since hi s eyes did not smile, and since his outward \\ncharacter was usually so reasonable and qui et, the sudden unmasking of his true self \\nwas frightening. \\nClemenza shook his head. “I don’ t want the money,” he said. Vito pocketed the bills. He \\nwaited. They all unde rstood each other. They knew he had killed Fanucci and though \\nthey never spoke about it to anyone the wh ole neighborhood, within a few weeks, also \\nknew. Vito Corleone was treat ed as a “man of respect” by everyone. But he made no  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 176\\nattempt to take over the Fanucci rackets and tributes. \\nWhat followed then was inevitable. One night Vito’s wife brought a neighbor, a widow, to \\nthe flat. The woman was Italian and of unim peachable character. She worked hard to \\nkeep a home for her fatherless children. Her sixteen-year-old son brought home his pay \\nenvelope sealed, to hand over to her in the old-country style; her seventeen-year-old \\ndaughter, a dressmaker, did the same. The wh ole family sewed buttons on cards at \\nnight at slave labor piece rates. The woman’s name was Signora Colombo. \\nVito Corleone’s wife said, “The Signora has a fa vor to ask of you. She is having some \\ntrouble.” \\nVito Corleone expected to be asked for m oney, which he was ready to give. But it \\nseemed that Mrs. Colombo owned a dog whic h her youngest son adored. The landlord \\nhad received complaints on the dog barking at night and had told Mrs. Colombo to get rid of it. She had pretended to do so: The landlord had found out that she had deceived \\nhim and had ordered her to vacate her apartm ent. She had promised this time to truly \\nget rid of the dog and  she had done so. But the landlord was so an gry that he would not \\nrevoke his order. She had to get out or t he police would be summoned to put her out. \\nAnd her poor little boy had cri ed so when they had given the dog away to relatives who \\nlived in Long Island. All for nothing, they would lose their home. \\nVito Corleone asked her gently, “Why do you ask me to help you?” \\nMrs. Colombo nodded toward his wife.  “She told me to ask you.” \\nHe was surprised. His wife had never questi oned him about the clothes he had washed \\nthe night he had murdered Fanucci. Had never  asked him where all the money came \\nfrom when he was not working. Even now her face was impassive. Vito said to Mrs. \\nColombo, “I can give you some money to help you move, is that what you want?” \\nThe woman shook her head, she was in tears. “All my friends are here, all the girls I \\ngrew up with in Italy. How can I move to  another neighborhood wit h strangers? I want \\nyou to speak to the landlord to let me stay.” \\nVito nodded. “It’s done then. You won’t have to move. I’ll speak to him tomorrow \\nmorning.” \\nHis wife gave him a smile which he did not acknowledge, but he felt pleased. Mrs. Colombo looked a little uncertain. “You’re sure  he’ll say yes, the landlord?” she asked. \\n“Signor Roberto?” Vito said in a surprised vo ice. “Of course he will.  He’s a good-hearted  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 177\\nfellow. Once I explain how things are with y ou he’ll take pity on your misfortunes. Now \\ndon’t let it trouble you any more. Don’t get so  upset. Guard your health, for the sake of \\nyour children.” \\n* * *  \\nThe landlord, Mr. Roberto, came to the nei ghborhood every day to check on the row of \\nfive tenements that he owned.  He was a padrone, a man who sold Italian laborers just \\noff the boat to the big corporations. With  his profits he had bought  the tenements one by \\none. An educated man from  the North of Italy, he felt onl y contempt for these illiterate \\nSoutherners from Sicily and Naples, who sw armed like vermin through his buildings, \\nwho threw garbage down the air shafts, who le t cockroaches and rats eat away his walls \\nwithout lifting a hand to preser ve his property. He was not a bad man, he was a good \\nhusband and father, but const ant worry about his invest ments, about the money he \\nearned, about the inevitable ex penses that came with being a man of property had worn \\nhis nerves to a frazzle so t hat he was in a constant stat e of irritation. When Vito \\nCorleone stopped him on the street to ask fo r a word, Mr. Roberto was brusque. Not \\nrude, since any one of these Southerners might stick a kn ife into you if rubbed the \\nwrong way, though this young man looked like a quiet fellow. \\n“Signor Roberto,” said Vito Co rleone, “the friend of  my wife, a poor widow with no man \\nto protect her, tells me that  for some reason she has been ordered to move from her \\napartment in your building. She is in des pair. She has no money, she has no friends \\nexcept those that live here. I told her th at I would speak to you, that you are a \\nreasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the \\nanimal that caused all the tr ouble and so why shouldn’t s he stay? As one Italian to \\nanother, I ask you the favor.” \\nSignor Roberto studied the youn g man in front of him. He saw a man of medium stature \\nbut strongly built, a peasant but not a b andit, though he so laughably dared to call \\nhimself an Italian. Roberto shrugged. “I hav e already rented the apartment to another \\nfamily for higher rent,” he said. “I cannot di sappoint them for the sake of your friend.” \\nVito Corleone nodded in agree able understanding. “How much more a month?” he \\nasked. \\n“Five dollars,” Mr. Roberto said. This was a lie . The railway flat, four dark rooms, rented \\nfor twelve dollars a month to the widow and he had not been able to get more than that \\nfrom the new tenant.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 178\\n* * *  \\nVito Corleone took a roll of bi lls out of his pocket and peeled off three tens. “Here is the \\nsix months’ increase in adv ance. You needn’t speak to her  about it, she’s a proud \\nwoman. See me again in another six months. But of course you’ll let her keep her dog.” \\n“Like hell,” Mr. Roberto said. “And who the he ll are you to give me orders. Watch your \\nmanners or you’ll be out on your Sici lian ass in the street there.” \\nVito Corleone raised his hands in surprise. “I ’m asking you a favor, only that. One never \\nknows when one might need a fri end, isn’t that true? Here, take this money as a sign of \\nmy goodwill and make your own decision. I woul dn’t dare to quarrel with it.” He thrust \\nthe money into Mr. Roberto’s hand. “Do me this little favor, just take the money and \\nthink things over. Tomorrow morning if you want to give me t he money back by all \\nmeans do so. If you want the wo man out of your house, how  can I stop you? It’s your \\nproperty, after all. If you don’t want the dog in there, I can understand. I dislike animals myself.” He patted Mr. Roberto on the shoulder . “Do me this service, eh? I won’t forget \\nit. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me , they’ll tell you I’m a man who believes \\nin showing his gratitude.” \\nBut of course Mr. Roberto had already be gun to understand. That evening he made \\ninquiries about Vito Co rleone. He did not wait until the ne xt morning. He knocked on the \\nCorleone door that very ni ght, apologizing for the lateness of the hour and accepted a \\nglass of wine from Signora Corl eone. He assured Vito Corleone  that it had all been a \\ndreadful misunderstanding, that of course Signora Colombo could remain in the flat, of \\ncourse she could keep her dog. Who were t hose miserable tenants to complain about \\nnoise from a poor animal when they paid such a low rent? At the finish he threw the \\nthirty dollars Vito Corleone had given him on the table and said in the most sincere \\nfashion, “Your good heart in helping this poo r widow has shamed me and I wish to show \\nthat I, too, have some Ch ristian charity. Her rent will remain what it was.” \\nAll concerned played this comedy prettily . Vito poured wine, called for cakes, wrung Mr. \\nRoberto’s hand and praised his warm heart. Mr. Roberto sighed and said that having \\nmade the acquaintance of such  a man as Vito Corleone restored his faith in human \\nnature. Finally they tore themselves away  from each other. Mr. Roberto, his bones \\nturned to jelly with fear at his narrow esca pe, caught the streetcar to his home in the \\nBronx and took to his bed. He did not reappear in his tenements for three days. \\n* * *   “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 179\\nVito Corleone was now a “man of respect” in  the neighborhood. He was reputed to be a \\nmember of the Mafia of Sicily. One day a man who ran card games in a furnished room \\ncame to him and voluntarily pa id him twenty dollars each week for his “friendship.” He \\nhad only to visit the game onc e or twice a week to let t he players understand they were \\nunder his protection. \\nStore owners who had probl ems with young hoodlums asked him to intercede. He did \\nso and was properly rewarded.  Soon he had the enormous income for that time and \\nplace of one hundred dollars a week. Since Clemenza and Tessio were his friends, his \\nallies, he had to give them each part of the money, but this he di d without being asked. \\nFinally he decided to go into the olive oi l, importing business with his boyhood chum, \\nGenco Abbandundo. Genco would handle the business, the im porting of the olive oil \\nfrom Italy, the buying at the proper price, the storing in his father’s warehouse. Genco \\nhad the experience for this part of the business. Clemenza and Tessio would be the \\nsalesmen. They would go to every Italian gr ocery store in Manhatt an, then Brooklyn, \\nthen the Bronx, to persuade stor e owners to stock Genco Pura  olive oil. (With typical \\nmodesty, Vito Corleone refused to name the brand after himself.) Vito of course would \\nbe the head of the firm since he was supplying most of the capital. He also would be \\ncalled in on special cases, where store owners resisted the sales talks of Clemenza and \\nTessio. Then Vito Corleone would use hi s own formidable powers of persuasion. \\nFor the next few years Vito Corleone lived t hat completely satisfying life of a small \\nbusinessman wholly devoted to building up his commercial enterprise in a dynamic, \\nexpanding economy. He was a devoted father and husband but so busy he could spare \\nhis family little of his time. As Genco Pura olive oil grew to  become the bestselling \\nimported Italian oil in  America, his organization mush roomed. Like any good salesman \\nhe came to understand the benefits of undercutting hi s rivals in price, barring them from \\ndistribution outlets by persuading store owner s to stock less of their brands. Like any \\ngood businessman he aimed at holding a monopoly by forcing his rivals to abandon the \\nfield or by merging with his own company. Ho wever, since he had started off relatively \\nhelpless, economically, since he did not believ e in advertising, relying on word of mouth \\nand since if truth be told, his olive oil was no  better than his competitors’, he could not \\nuse the common stranglehol ds of legitimate businessmen. He  had to rely on the force of \\nhis own personality and his reputat ion as a “man of respect.” \\nEven as a young man, Vito Corleone became known as a “man of reasonableness.” He \\nnever uttered a threat. He always used logi c that proved to be i rresistible. He always  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 180\\nmade certain that the other fell ow got his share of profit. Nobody lost. He did this, of \\ncourse, by obvious means. Like many busi nessmen of genius he learned that free \\ncompetition was wasteful, monopoly efficient. And so he simply set about achieving that \\nefficient monopoly. There were some oil wholesalers is Brooklyn, men of fiery temper, \\nheadstrong, not amenable to reason, who refused to see, to recognize, the vision of Vito \\nCorleone, even after he had ex plained everything to them with the utmost patience and \\ndetail. With these men Vito Corleone threw up his hands is despair and sent Tessio to \\nBrooklyn to set up a headquarters and solve the problem. Warehouses were burned, \\ntruckloads of olive-green oil were dumped to form lakes in the cobbled waterfront \\nstreets. One rash man, an a rrogant Milanese with more faith in the police than a saint \\nhas in Christ, actually went to the authoritie s with a complaint against  his fellow Italians, \\nbreaking the ten-century-old law, of omerta. But before the matter could progress any \\nfurther the wholesaler disappeared, never to be seen again, leavi ng behind, deserted, \\nhis devoted wife and three children, who, G od be thanked, were fully grown and capable \\nof taking over his business and coming to terms with the Genco Pura oil company. \\nBut great men are not born gr eat, they grow great, and so it was with Vito Corleone. \\nWhen prohibition came to pa ss and alcohol forbidden to be sold, Vito Corleone made \\nthe final step from a quite ordinary, somew hat ruthless businessman to a great Don in \\nthe world of criminal enterpr ise. It did not happen in a day, it did not happen in a year, \\nbut by the end of the Prohibition period and the start of the Great Depression, Vito \\nCorleone had become the Godfather, the Don, Don Corleone. \\nIt started casually enough. By this time the Genco Pura Oil Company  had a fleet of six \\ndelivery trucks. Through Clemenza, Vito Corleone was approached by a group of Italian bootleggers who smuggled alco hol and whiskey in from C anada. They needed trucks \\nand deliverymen to distribute their produce over New York City. They needed \\ndeliverymen who were reliable, discreet and of a certain det ermination and force. They \\nwere willing to pay Vito Corleone for hi s trucks and for his men. The fee was so \\nenormous that Vito Corleone cut back drastica lly on his oil business to use the trucks \\nalmost exclusively for the service of the boot legger-smugglers. This despite the fact that \\nthese gentlemen had accompanied their offer with a silky threat. But even then Vito \\nCarleone was so mature a man t hat he did not take insult at  a threat or become angry \\nand refuse a profitable offer because of it. He  evaluated the threat, found it lacking in \\nconviction, and lowered his opinion of hi s new partners because they had been so \\nstupid to use threats where none were needed. This was us eful information to be  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 181\\npondered at its proper time. \\nAgain he prospered. But, more  important, he acquired k nowledge and contacts and \\nexperience. And he piled up good deeds as a banker piles up securities. For in the \\nfollowing years it became clear  that Vito Corleone was not on ly a man of talent but, in \\nhis way, a genius. \\nHe made himself the protector of the Itali an families who set themselves up as small \\nspeakeasies in their homes, selling whiskey at fifteen cents a glass to bachelor laborers. He became godfather t Mrs. Colombo’s youngest son when the lad made his \\nconfirmation and gave a handsome present of a twenty-dollar gold piece. Meanwhile, \\nsince it was inevitable t hat some of his trucks be stopped by the police, Genco \\nAbbandando hired a fine lawyer with many contacts in the Police Department and the \\njudiciary. A system of payoffs was set up and soon the Corleone organization had a \\nsizable “sheet,” the list of officials entitled to a monthly sum. When the lawyer tried to \\nkeep this list down, apologizing for the expens e, Vito Corleone reassured him. “No; no,” \\nhe said. “Get everyone on it even if they ca n’t help us right now. I believe in friendship \\nand I am willing to show my friendship first.” \\nAs time went by the Corleone empire be came larger, more trucks were added, the \\n“sheet” grew longer. Also the men working directly for Tessio and Clemenza grew in number. The whole thing was becoming unwield y. Finally Vito Corleone worked out a \\nsystem of organization. He gave Clemenza and Tessio each the title of Caporegime, or captain, and the men who wo rked beneath them the rank of  soldier. He named Genco \\nAbbandando his counselor, or C onsigliere. He put layers of  insulation between himself \\nand any operational act. When he gave an order it was to Genco or to one of the \\ncaporegimes alone. Rarely did he have a wit ness to any order he gave any particular \\none of them. Then he split Tessio’s group and made it responsible for Brooklyn. He also split Tessio off from Clemenza and made it clear over the year s that he did not want the \\ntwo men to associate even socially except  when absolutely necessary. He explained \\nthis to the more intelligent Tessio, wh o caught his drift immediately, though Vito \\nexplained it as a security measure against the law. Tessio underst ood that Vito did not \\nwant his two caporegimes to have any opportunity to conspire against him and he also \\nunderstood there was no ill will involved, merely a tactical pr ecaution. In return Vito gave \\nTessio a free hand in Brooklyn wh ile he kept Clemenza’s Bronx life very much under his \\nthumb. Clemenza was the braver, more reckless, the crueler man despite his outward \\njollity, and needed a tighter rein.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 182\\nThe Great Depression increased the power of  Vito Corleone. And indeed it was about \\nthat time he came to be called Don Corleone. Everywhere in the city, honest men \\nbegged for honest work in vain. Proud men dem eaned themselves and their families to \\naccept official charity from  a contemptuous officialdom. But the men of Don Corleone \\nwalked the streets with their heads held high, their pockets stuffed with silver and paper \\nmoney. With no fear of losing their jobs. A nd even Don Corleone, that mgt modest of \\nmen, could not help feeling a sense of pride. He was taking care of his world, his \\npeople. He had not failed thos e who depended on him and gave him the sweat of their \\nbrows, risked their freedom and their lives in his service.  And when an employee of his \\nwas arrested and sent to prison by some mischance, that unfortunate man’s family \\nreceived a living allowance; and not a mise rly, beggarly, begrudgi ng pittance but the \\nsame amount the man earned when free. \\nThis of course was not pure Christian char ity. Not his best friends would have called \\nDon Corleone a saint from heaven. There was so me self-interest in this generosity. An \\nemployee sent to prison knew  he had only to keep his mouth shut and his wife and \\nchildren would be cared for. He knew that  if he did not inform to the police a warm \\nwelcome would be his when he left prison. Ther e would be a party waiting in his home, \\nthe best of food, homemade ravi oli, wine, pastries, with al l his friends and relatives \\ngathered to rejoice in his freedom. And some time during the night the Consigliere, \\nGenco Abbandando, or perhaps even the Don himself, would drop by to pay his \\nrespects to such a stalwart, take a gla ss of wine in his honor , and leave a handsome \\npresent of money so that he c ould enjoy a week or two of leisure with his family before \\nreturning to his daily toil. Such was the infinite sympathy and understanding of Don \\nCorleone. \\nIt was at this time that the Don got the id ea that he ran his world far better than his \\nenemies ran the greater world which continually obstructed his path. And this feeling \\nwas nurtured by the poor peopl e of the neighborhood  who constantly came to him for \\nhelp. To get on the home relief, to get a young boy a job or out  of jail, to borrow a small \\nsum of money desperately needed, to interv ene with landlords who against all reason \\ndemanded rent from jobless tenants. \\nDon Vito Corleone helped them all. Not onl y that, he helped them  with goodwill, with \\nencouraging words to take the bitter sting out of the charity he gave them. It was only \\nnatural then that when these Italians were pu zzled and confused on who to vote for to \\nrepresent them in the state legi slature, in the city offices, in the Congress, they should  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 183\\nask the advice of their friend Don Corleo ne, their Godfather. And so he became a \\npolitical power to be consulted by practical party chiefs. He consolidated this power with \\na far-seeing statesmanlike intell igence; by helping brilliant boys from poor Italian families \\nthrough college, boys who would la ter become lawyers, assistant district attorneys, and \\neven judges. He planned for the future of his empire with all the foresight of a great \\nnational leader. \\nThe repeal of Prohibit ion dealt this empire a crippling blow but again he had taken his \\nprecautions. In 1933 he sent emissaries to  the man who controlled all the gambling \\nactivities of Manhattan, the crap games on the docks, the shylocking that went with it as \\nhot dogs go with baseball games, the bookma king on sports and horses, the illicit \\ngambling houses that ran pok er games, the policy or numbers racket of Harlem. This \\nman’s name was Salvatore Maranzano  and he was one of the acknowledged \\npezzonovante,.90 calibers, or big shots of  the New York underworld. The Corleone \\nemissaries proposed to Maranz ano an equal partnersh ip beneficial to both parties. Vito \\nCorleone with his organization , his police and political contacts, could give the \\nMaranzano operations a stout umbrella and the ne w strength to expand  into Brooklyn \\nand the Bronx. But Maranzano was a short-si ghted man and spurned the Corleone offer \\nwith contempt. The great Al  Capone was Maranzano’s fr iend and he had his own \\norganization, his own men, plus a huge war c hest. He would not brook this upstart \\nwhose reputation was more that of a Pa rliamentary debater t han a true Mafioso. \\nMaranzano’s refusal touched off the great war of 1933 which was to change the whole \\nstructure of the underworld in New York City. \\nAt first glance it seemed an uneven matc h. Salvatore Maranzano had a powerful \\norganization with strong enforcers. He had a friendship with Capone in Chicago and \\ncould call on help in that quarter. He also  had a good relationship  with the Tattaglia \\nFamily, which controlled prostitu tion in the city and wh at there was of the thin drug traffic \\nat that time. He also had political contacts with powerful business leaders who used his \\nenforcers to terrorize the Je wish unionists in the garment  center and the Italian anarchist \\nsyndicates in the building trades. \\nAgainst this, Don Corleone could throw two sm all but superbly organized regimes led by \\nClemenza and Tessio. His politic al and police contacts we re negated by the business \\nleaders who would support Maranzano. But in  his favor was the enemy’s lack of \\nintelligence about his organization. The underwo rld did not know the true strength of his \\nsoldiers and even were deceived that  Tessio in Brooklyn was a separate and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 184\\nindependent operation. \\nAnd yet despite all this, it was an unequal battle until Vito Corleone evened out the odds \\nwith one master stroke. \\nMaranzano sent a call to Capone for his two best gunmen to come to New York to eliminate the upstart. The Corleone Family had friends and intelligence in Chicago who \\nrelayed the news that the two gunmen were a rriving by train. Vito  Corleone dispatched \\nLuca Brasi to take care of them with instructions that would liberate the strange man’s \\nmost savage instincts. \\nBrasi and his people, four of them, received the Chic ago hoods at the railroad station. \\nOne of Brasi’s men procured and drove a ta xicab for the purpose and the station porter \\ncarrying the bags led the Capone men to this  cab. When they got in, Brasi and another \\nof his men crowded in after them, guns ready, and made the two Chicago boys lie on \\nthe floor. The cab drove to a warehouse near the docks that Brasi had prepared for \\nthem. \\nThe two Capone men were bound han d and foot and small bath towels were stuffed into \\ntheir mouths to keep them from crying out. \\nThen Brasi took an ax from its place against  the wall and started hacking at one of the \\nCapone men. He chopped the man’s feet off, t hen the legs at the knees, then the thighs \\nwhere they joined the torso. Brasi was an ex tremely powerfull man but it took him many \\nswings to accomplish his purpose. By that time of course the victim had given up the \\nghost and the floor of the warehouse was sli ppery with the hacked fragments of his flesh \\nand the gouting of his blood. When Brasi turned to his sec ond victim he found further \\neffort unnecessary. The seco nd Capone gunman out  of sheer terror had, impossibly, \\nswallowed the bath towe l in his mouth and suffocated. T he bath towel was found in the \\nman’s stomach when the police performed their autopsy to determine the cause of \\ndeath. \\nA few days later in Chicago the Capones receiv ed a message from Vito Corleone. It was \\nto this effect: “You know now how I deal with enemies. Why does a Neapolitan interfere \\nin a quarrel between two Sicilians? If you wish me to consider you as a friend I owe you \\na service which I will pay on demand. A man like yourself must know how much more \\nprofitable it is to have a friend who, instead of  calling on you for help, takes care of his \\nown affairs and stands ever ready to help you in some future time of trouble. If you do \\nnot wish my friendship, so be it. But then I mu st tell you that the clim ate in this city is  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 185\\ndamp; unhealthy for Neapolitans, and you are advised never to visit it.” \\nThe arrogance of this letter was a calculat ed one. The Don held the Capones in small \\nesteem as stupid, obvious cutthroats. His  intelligence informed him that Capone had \\nforfeited all political influence because of his public arrogance and the flaunting of his \\ncriminal wealth. The Don knew, in fact was positive, that without political influence, \\nwithout the camouflage of society, Capone’s world, and others like it, could be easily \\ndestroyed. He knew Capone wa s on the path to destruction. He also knew that \\nCapone’s influence did not extend beyond the boundaries of Chicago, terrible and \\nall-pervading as that influence there might be. \\nThe tactic was successful. Not so much bec ause of its ferocity but because of the \\nchilling swiftness, the quicknes s of the Don’s reac tion. If his intelligence was so good, \\nany further moves would be fraught with danger . It was better, far wis er, to accept the \\noffer of friendship with its implied payoff. T he Capones, sent back word that they would \\nnot interfere. \\nThe odds were now equal. And Vito Corl eone had earned an enormous amount of \\n“respect” throughout the United States underworld with his humiliation of the Capones. \\nFor six months he out-general ed Maranzano. He raided the crap games under that \\nman’s protection, located his biggest policy banker in Harlem and had him relieved of a \\nday’s play not only in money but in records. He engaged hi s enemies on all fronts. Even \\nin the garment centers he sent Clemenza and his men to fight on the side of the \\nunionists against the enforcers  on the payroll of Maranzano and the owners of the dress \\nfirms. And on all fronts his superior intellig ence and organization made him the victor. \\nClemenza’s jolly ferocity, which Corleone employ ed judiciously, also he lped turn the tide \\nof battle. And then Don Corleo ne sent the held-back reserve of the Tessio regime after \\nMaranzano himself. \\nBy this time Maranzano had dispatched emissaries suing for a peace. Vito Corleone \\nrefused to see them, put them off on one pretext or another. The Maranzano soldiers \\nwere deserting their leader, not wishing to die in a losing cause. Bookmakers and \\nshylocks were paying the Corleone organization their protection money. The war was all \\nbut over. \\nAnd then finally on New Year’s Eve of 1933. Tessio got inside the defenses of \\nMaranzano himself. The Maranzano lieutenants were anxious for a deal and agreed to \\nlead their chief to the slaughter. They told  him that a meeting had been arranged in a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 186\\nBrooklyn restaurant with Co rleone and they accom panied Maranzano as his \\nbodyguards. They left hum sitting at a checkered table, morosely munching a piece of \\nbread, and fled the restaurant as Tessio and f our of his men entered. The execution was \\nswift and sure. Maranzano, his mouth full of half-chewed bread, was riddled with bullets. The war was over. \\nThe Maranzano empire was incorporated into the Corleone operation.  Don Corleone set \\nup a system of tribute, allowing  all incumbents to remain in their bookmaking and policy \\nnumber spots. As a bonus he had a foothold in the unions of the ga rment center which \\nin later years was to prove extremely im portant. And now that he had settled his \\nbusiness affairs the Don found trouble at home. \\nSantino Corleone, Sonny, was si xteen years old and grown to an astonishing six feet \\nwith broad shoulders and a heavy face that was sensual but by no means effeminate. \\nBut where Fredo was a quiet boy, and Michael, of course , a toddler, Santino was \\nconstantly in trouble. He got into fights, did badly in school and, finally, Clemenza, who \\nwas the boy’s godfather and had a duty to speak, came to Don Corleone one evening \\nand informed him that his son had taken part in an armed robbery, a stupid affair which could have gone very badly. Sonny was obvidusly  the ringleader, t he two other boys in \\nthe robbery his followers. \\nIt was one of the very few times that Vito  Corleone lost his temper. Tom Hagen had \\nbeen living in his home for three years and he asked Clemenza if the orphan boy had \\nbeen involved. Clemenza shook hi s head. Don Corleone had a car sent to bring Santino \\nto his offices in the Genco Pura Olive Oil Company. \\nFor the first time, the Don met defeat. Alone with his son, he gave full vent to his rage, \\ncursing the hulking Sonny in Sicilian dialec t, a language so much more satisfying than \\nany other for expressing rage.  He ended up with a question. “What gave you the right to \\ncommit such an act? What made you wish to commit such an act?” \\nSonny stood there, angry, refusing to answe r. The Don said with contempt, “And so \\nstupid. What did you earn for that night’s work? Fifty dolla rs each? Twenty dollars? You \\nrisked your life for twenty dollars, eh?” \\nAs if he had not heard these last  words, Sonny said defiantly, “I saw you kill Fanucci.” \\nThe Don said, “Ahhh” and sank back in his chair. He waited. \\nSonny said, “When Fanucci left t he building, Mama said I could go up the house. I saw \\nyou go up the roof and I followe d you. I saw everything you did. I stayed up there and I  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 187\\nsaw you throw away the wallet and the gun.” \\nThe Don sighed. “Well, then I can’t talk to you about how you should behave. Don’t you \\nwant to finish school, don’t you want to be a lawyer? Lawyers can steal more money \\nwith a briefcase than a thous and men with guns and masks.” \\nSonny grinned at him and said slyly, “I want  to enter the family business.” When he saw \\nthat the Don’s face remained impassive, t hat he did not laugh at the joke, he added \\nhastily, “I can learn how to sell olive oil.” \\nStill the Don did not answer. Finally he shr ugged. “Every man has one destiny,” he said. \\nHe did not add that t he witnessing of Fanucci’s murder had decided that of his son. He \\nmerely turned away and added quietly, “Com e in tomorrow morning at nine o’clock. \\nGenco will show you what to do.” \\nBut Genco Abbandando, wit h that shrewd insight that a C onsigliere must have, realized \\nthe true wish of the Don and used  Sonny mostly as a bodyguar d for his father, a position \\nin which he could also learn the subtleti es of being a Don. And it brought out a \\nprofessorial instinct in the Don himself, who often gave lectures on how to succeed for \\nthe benefit of his eldest son. \\nBesides his oft-repeated theor y that a man has but one des tiny, the Don constantly \\nreproved Sonny for that young man’s outbursts of temper. The Don considered a use of \\nthreats the most foolish kind of exposure; the unleashing of  anger without forethought as \\nthe most dangerous indulgence.  No one had ever heard t he Don utter a naked threat, \\nno one had ever seen him in an uncontrollabl e rage. It was unthinkable. And so he tried \\nto teach Sonny his own disciplines. He claimed that there was no greater natural \\nadvantage in life than having an enemy overestimate your faults, unless it was to have a \\nfriend underestimate your virtues. \\nThe caporegime, Clemenza, took, Sonny in hand and taught him how  to shoot and to \\nwield a garrot. Sonny had no taste for the It alian rope, he was too Americanized. He \\npreferred the simple, direct, impersonal Anglo-Saxon gun,  which saddened Clemenza. \\nBut Sonny became a constant and welcome co mpanion to his father, driving his car, \\nhelping him in little details. For the next two years he seemed like the usual son entering his father’s business, not too bright, not too eager, content to hold down a soft job. \\nMeanwhile his boyhood chum and semiadopted brother Tom Hagen was going to college. Fredo was still in high school; Mic hael, the youngest brother, was in grammar \\nschool, and baby sister Connie was a toddling girl of four. The family had long since  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 188\\nmoved to an apartment house in the Bronx.  Don Corleone was c onsidering buying a \\nhouse in Long Island, but he wanted to fit this  in with other plans he was formulating. \\nVito Corleone was a man with vision. All the gr eat cities of America were being torn by \\nunderworld strife. Guerrilla wars by the doz en flared up, ambitious hoodlums trying to \\ncarve themselves a bit of empire; men like Corleone himself were trying to keep their \\nborders and rackets secure. Don Corleone saw that the newspapers and government \\nagencies were using these killings to get strict er and stricter laws, to use harsher police \\nmethods. He foresaw that public indignati on might even lead to a suspension of \\ndemocratic procedures which could be fatal to him and his people. His own empire, \\ninternally, was secure. He decided to bring p eace to all the warring factions in New York \\nCity and then in the nation. \\nHe had no illusions about the dangerousness of  his mission. He spent the first year \\nmeeting with different chiefs of gangs in  New York, laying the groundwork, sounding \\nthem out, proposing spheres of influence that would be honored by a loosely bound \\nconfederated council. But there we re too many factions, too m any special interests that \\nconflicted. Agreement wa s impossible. Like ot her great rulers and lawgivers in history \\nDon Corteone decided that or der and peace were impossi ble until the number of \\nreigning states had been reduced to a manageable number. \\nThere were five or six “Families” too pow erful to eliminate. But the rest, the \\nneighborhood Black Hand terrorists, t he free-lance shylocks, the strong-arm \\nbookmakers operating without the proper, that is to say paid,  protection of the legal \\nauthorities, would have to go. And so he mounted what was in effect a colonial war \\nagainst these people and threw all the resour ces of the Corleone organization against \\nthem. \\nThe pacification of the New York area took three years and had some unexpected \\nrewards. At first it took the form of bad lu ck. A group of mad-dog Iris h stickup artists the \\nDon had marked for extermination almost carried the day with sheer Emerald Isle elan. \\nBy chance, and with suicidal bravery, one of these Irish gunmen pierced the Don’s \\nprotective cordon and put a shot into his chest. The assassin was immediately riddled \\nwith bullets but the damage was done. \\nHowever this gave Sanrtino Corleone his chanc e. With his father out of action, Sonny \\ntook command of a troop, his own regime , with the rank of caporegime, and like a \\nyoung, untrumpeted Napoleon, s howed a genius for city warf are. He also showed a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 189\\nmerciless ruthlessness, the lack of whic h had been Don Corleone’ s only fault as a \\nconqueror. \\nFrom 1935 to 1937 Sonny Corleond made a reputation as the most cunning and \\nrelentless executioner the underworld had yet known. Yet for sheer terror even he was \\neclipsed by the awesome man named Luca Brasi. \\nIt was Brasi who went after the rest of the Irish gunmen and single-handedly wiped them \\nout. It was Brasi, operating alone  when one of the six powerful families tried to interfere \\nand become the protector of the independents, who assassinated the head of the family \\nas a warning. Shortly after, the Don recovered from his wound and made peace with \\nthat particular family. \\nBy 1937 peace and harmony reigned in New York City except for minor  incidents, minor \\nmisunderstandings which were, of  course, sometimes fatal. \\nAs the rulers of ancient cities always kept  an anxious eye on the barbarian tribes roving \\naround their walls, so Don Corleone kept an ey e on the affairs of the world outside his \\nworld. He noted the coming of  Hitler, the fall of Spain,  Germany’s strong-arming of \\nBritain at Munich. Unblinkered by that outside world, he sa w clearly the coming global \\nwar and he understood the implicat ions. His own world would be more impregnable than \\nbefore. Not only that, fortunes could be made in time of war by alert, foresighted folk. \\nBut to do so peace must reign in his dom ain while war raged in the world outside. \\nDon Corleone carried his message through the United States. He conferred with \\ncompatriots in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, \\nand Boston. He was the underworld apostle of peace and, by,1939, more successful \\nthan any Pope, he had achieved a worki ng agreement amongst the most powerful \\nunderworld organizations in the country. Like t he Constitution of the United States this \\nagreement respected fully the internal authorit y of each member in his state or city. The \\nagreement veered only spheres of influence and an agreement to enforce peace in the \\nunderworld. \\nAnd so when World War II broke out in 1939, when the Unit ed States, joined the conflict \\nin 1941, the world of Don Vito Corleone was at peace, in order, fully prepared to reap the golden harvest on equal terms with all t he other industries of  a booming America. \\nThe Corleone Family had a hand in supplying black-market OPA food stamps, gasoline stamps, even travel priorities. It could help get war contract s and then help get \\nblack-market materials for those garment center clothing firms who were not given  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 190\\nenough raw material because they  did not have government contracts. He could even \\nget all the young men in his organization, thos e eligible for Army draft, excused from \\nfighting in the foreign war. He did this wit h the aid of doctors. who advised what drugs \\nhad to be taken before physical examination, or by placing the men in draft-exempt \\npositions in the war industries. \\nAnd so the Don could take prid e in his rule. His world was safe for those who had sworn \\nloyalty to him; other men wh o believed in law and  order were dying by the millions. The \\nonly fly in the ointment was that his own so n, Michael Corleone, refused to be helped, \\ninsisted on volunteering to serv e his own country. And to the Don’s astonishment, so did \\na few of his other young men in  the organization. One of the men, trying to explain this \\nto his caporegime, said, “This country has been good to me.” Upon this story being \\nrelayed to the Don he said angrily to the ca poregime, “I have been good to him.” It might \\nhave gone badly for these people but, as he had excused his son Michael, so must he \\nexcuse other young men who so misunderstood their duty to their Don and to \\nthemselves. \\nAt the end of World War II Don Corleone k new that again his world would have to \\nchange its ways, that it would ha ve to fit itself more snugly into the ways of the other, \\nlarger world. He believed he coul d do this with no loss of profit. \\nThere was reason for this belief in his own experience. What had put him on the right \\ntrack were two personal affairs. Early in his career the then-young Nazorine, only a baker’s helper planning to get married, had come to him fo r assistance. He and his \\nfuture bride, a good Italian girl, had save d their money and had paid the enormous sum \\nof three hundred dollars to a wholesaler of furniture recommended to them. This \\nwholesaler had let them pick out everything they wanted to furnish their tenement \\napartment. A fine sturdy bedroo m set with two bureaus and lamp s. Also the living room \\nset of heavy stuffed sofa and stuffed armchai rs, all covered with rich gold-threaded \\nfabric. Nazorine and his fianc ee had spent a happy day pi cking out what they wanted \\nfrom the huge warehouse crowded with furniture. The whol esaler took their money, their \\nthree hundred dollars wrung from  the sweat of their blood, and pocketed it and promised \\nthe furniture to be delivered within the week to the already rented flat. \\nThe very next week however, the firm had gone into bankruptcy. The great warehouse \\nstocked with furniture had been sealed shut and attached for payment of creditors. The \\nwholesaler had disappeared to gi ve other creditors time to unleash their anger on the \\nempty air. Nazorine, one of these, went to his lawyer, who told him nothing could be  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 191\\ndone until the case was settled in court and all cr editors satisfied. This might take three \\nyears and Nazorine would be lucky to get back ten cents on the dollar. \\nVito Corleone listened to this story with am used disbelief. It was not possible that the \\nlaw could allow such thievery. The wholesal er owned his own palatia l home, an estate in \\nLong Island, a luxurious automobile, and was seeding his children to college. How could \\nhe keep the three hundred doll ars of the poor baker Nazorine and not give him the \\nfurniture he had paid for? But, to make  sure, Vito Corleone had Genco Abbandando \\ncheck it out with the lawyers who represented the Genco Pura company. \\nThey verified the story of Na zorine. The wholesaler had al l his personal wealth in his \\nwife’s name. His furniture business was in corporated and he was not personally liable. \\nTrue, he had shown bad faith by  taking the money of Nazo rine when he knew he was \\ngoing to file bankruptcy but this was a common practice. Under law there was nothing to \\nbe done. \\nOf course the matter was easily adjusted. Don Corleone sent his Consigliere, Genco \\nAbbandando, to speak to the wholesaler, a nd as was to be expected, that wide-awake \\nbusinessman caught the drift immediately and a rranged for Nazorine to get his furniture. \\nBut it was an interesting lesson for the young Vito Corleone. \\nThe second incident had more far-reaching  repercussions. In 19 39, Don Corleone had \\ndecided to move his family out of the city . Like any other parent he wanted his children \\nto go to better schools and mi x with better companions. Fo r his own personal reasons \\nhe wanted the anonymity of suburban life w here his reputation wa s not known. He \\nbought the mall property in Long Beach, which at that time  had only four newly built \\nhouses but with plenty of room for more. Sonny was formally engaged to Sandra and \\nwould soon marry, one of the houses would be for him. One of the houses was for the \\nDon. Another was for Genco Abbandando and his family. The other was kept vacant at \\nthe time. \\nA week after the mall was occupied, a group of three workmen came in all innocence with their truck. They claimed to be furnace in spectors for the town of Long Beach. One \\nof the Don’s young bodyguards let the men in and led them to the furnace in the \\nbasement. The Don, his wife and Sonny were in the garden taking their ease and \\nenjoying the salty sea air. \\nMuch to the Don’s annoyance he was summ oned into the house by his bodyguard. The \\nthree workmen, all big burly fellows, we re grouped around the furnace. They had taken  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 192\\nit apart, it was strewn around the cement basement floor. Their leader, an authoritative \\nman, said to the Don in a gruff voice, “Your furnace is in lousy shape. If you want us to \\nfix it and put it together again, it’ll cost you one hundred fifty dollars for labor and parts \\nand then we’ll pass you for county inspection.” He took out a red p aper label. “We stamp \\nthis seal on it, see, then nobody from the county bothers you again.” \\nThe Don was amused. It had been a boring, qui et week in which he had had to neglect \\nhis business to take care of such family det ails moving to a new house entailed. In more \\nbroken English than his usual slight accent he asked, “If I don’t pay you, what happens \\nto my furnace?” \\nThe leader of the three men sh rugged. “We just leave the fur nace the way it is now.” He \\ngestured at the metal parts  strewn over the floor. \\nThe Don said meekly, “Wait, I’ll get you your  money.” Then he went out into the garden \\nand said to Sonny, “Listen, there’s some men working on the fur nace, I don’t understand \\nwhat they want. Go in and take care of t he matter.” It was not simply a joke; he was \\nconsidering making his son his underboss. This was one of the tests a business \\nexecutive had to pass. \\nSonny’s solution did not altogether please his father. It was too direct, too lacking in \\nSicilian subtleness. He was the Club, not the Rapier. For as soon as Sonny heard the \\nleader’s demand he held the three men at gunpoint and had them thoroughly \\nbastinadoed by the bodyguards. Then he made them put the furnace together again and \\ntidy up the basement. He searched them and f ound that they actually were employed by \\na house-improvement firm with h eadquarters in Suffolk County. He learned the name of \\nthe man who owned the firm. Th en he kicked the three men to their truck. “Don’t let me \\nsee you in Long Beach again,” he told them. “I’ll have your balls hanging from your \\nears.” \\nIt was typical of the young Santino, before he became older and crueler, that he \\nextended his protection to the community he lived in. Sonny paid a personal call to the \\nhome-improvement firm owner and told him not  to send any of his men into the Long \\nBeach area ever again. As soon as the Corleone Family set up their usual business \\nliaison with the local police force they were informed of all such complaints and all \\ncrimes by professional cr iminals. In less than a year Long Beach became the most \\ncrime-free town of its size  in the United States. Prof essional stickup artists and \\nstrong-arms received one warning not to ply their trade in  the town. They were allowed  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 193\\none offense. When they committed a second they simply disappeared. The flimflam \\nhome-improvement gyp artists, the door-to-door con men were politely warned that they \\nwere not welcome in Long Beach. Those confident con men who disregarded the \\nwarning were beaten within an inch of their lives. Resident young punks who had no \\nrespect for law and proper authorit y were advised in the most  fatherly fashion to run \\naway from home. Long Beac h became a model city. \\nWhat impressed the Don was t he legal validity of these sa les swindles. Clearly there \\nwas a place for a man of his talents in that other world which had been closed to him as \\nan honest youth. He took appropriat e steps to enter that world. \\nAnd so he lived happily on the mall in Long Beach, consolidating and enlarging his \\nempire, until after the war was over, the Turk  Sollozzo broke the peace and plunged the \\nDon’s world into its own war, and brought him to his hospital bed. \\nBook Four  \\nChapter 15 \\nIn the New Hampshire village, every fo reign phenomenon was properly noticed by \\nhousewives peering from windows, storekeepers lounging behind thei r doors. And so \\nwhen the black automobile bearing New York  license plates stopped in front of the \\nAdams’ home, every citizen knew about it in a matter of minutes. \\nKay Adams, really a small-to wn girl despite her college education, was also peering \\nfrom her bedroom window. She had been studying for her exam s and preparing to go \\ndownstairs for lunch when she spotted the car coming up the street, and for some \\nreason she was not surprised when it rolled to  a halt in front of her lawn. Two men got \\nout, big burly men who looked like gangsters in  the movies to her eyes, and she flew \\ndown the stairs to be the first at the door. S he was sure they came from Michael or his \\nfamily and she didn’t want them talki ng to her father and mother without any \\nintroduction. It wasn’t that she was ashamed of any of Mike’s friends, she thought; it was \\njust that her mother and father were old- fashioned New England Yankees and wouldn’t \\nunderstand her even knowing such people. \\nShe got to the door just as t he bell rang and she called to her mother, “I’ll get it.” She \\nopened the door and the two big men stood there. O ne reached inside his breast pocket \\nlike a gangster reaching for a gun and the move so surprised Kay that she let out a little \\ngasp but the man had taken out a small leather case which he flapped open to show an  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 194\\nidentification card. “I’m Detect ive John Phillips from the New York Police Department,” \\nhe said. He motioned to the other man, a dar k-complexioned man with very thick, very \\nblack eyebrows. “This is my partner, Dete ctive Siriani. Are you Miss Kay Adams?” \\nKay nodded. Phillips said, “May we come in and talk to you for a few minutes. It’s about \\nMichael Corleone.” \\nShe stood aside to let them in. At that moment  her father appeared in  the small side hall \\nthat led to his study. “Kay, what is it?” he asked. \\nHer father was a gray-haired, slender, dist inguished-looking man who not only was the \\npastor of the town Baptist chur ch but had a reputation in reli gious circles as a scholar. \\nKay really didn’t know her fa ther well, he puzzled her, but s he knew he loved her even if \\nhe gave the impression he foun d her uninteresting as a per son. Though they had never \\nbeen close, she trusted him. So she said si mply, “These men are detectives from New \\nYork. They want to ask me questions about a boy I know.” \\nMr. Adams didn’t seem surprised. “Why don’t we go into my study?” he said. \\nDetective Phillips said gently, “We’d rather talk to your daughter alone, Mr. Adams.” \\nMr. Adams said courteously, “That depends on Ka y, I think. My dear, would-you rather \\nspeak to these gentlemen alone  or would you prefer to have me present? Or perhaps \\nyour mother?” \\nKay shook her head. “I’ll talk to them alone.” \\nMr. Adams said to Phillips, “You can use my study. Will you stay for lunch?” The two \\nmen shook their heads. Kay led them into the study. \\nThey rested uncomfortably on the edge of the couch as she sat in her father’s big \\nleather chair. Detective Phill ips opened the conversation by saying, “Miss Adams, have \\nyou seen or heard from Michael Corleone at any  time in the last three weeks?” The one \\nquestion was enough to warn her. Thr ee weeks ago she had read the Boston \\nnewspapers with their headlines about the killing of a New York police captain and a \\nnarcotics smuggler named Virgil Sollozzo. T he newspaper had said it was part of the \\ngang war involving the Corleone Family. \\nKay shook her head. “No, the last time I saw him he was going to s ee his father in the \\nhospital. That was perhaps a month ago.” \\nThe other detective said in a harsh voice, “We know all about that meeting. Have you \\nseen or heard from him since then?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 195\\n“No,” Kay said. \\nDetective Phillips said in a polite voice, “ If you do have contact with him we’d like you to \\nlet us know. It’s very important we get to talk  to Michael Corleone. I must warn you that \\nif you do have contact with him you may be getting involved in a very dangerous \\nsituation. If you help him in any way, you may get yourself in very serious trouble.” \\nKay sat up very straight in the chair. “Why  shouldn’t I help him?” she asked. “We’re \\ngoing to be married, marri ed people help each other.” \\nIt was Detective Siriani who answered her. “I f you help, you may be an accessory to \\nmurder. We’re looking for your boy friend bec ause he killed a police captain in New York \\nplus an informer the police officer was cont acting. We know Michael Corleone is the \\nperson who did the shooting.” \\nKay laughed. Her laughter was so unaffected, so incredulous, that the officers were \\nimpressed. “Mike wouldn’t do anything like th at,” she said. “He never had anything to do \\nwith his family. When we went to his sister’s wedding it wa s obvious that he was treated \\nas an outsider, almost as much as I was. If he’ s hiding now it’s just so that he won’t get \\nany publicity, so his name won’t be dragged through all this. Mike is not a gangster. I \\nknow him better than you or anybody else can know him. He is too nice a man to do \\nanything as despicable as murder. He is the most law-abiding person I know, and I’ve \\nnever known him to lie.” \\nDetective Phillips asked gentiy, “How long have you known him?” \\n“Over a year,” Kay said and was su rprised when the two men smiled. \\n“I think there are a few things you should know ,” Detective Phillips said. “On the night he \\nleft you, he went to the hospital. When he came out he got into an argument with a \\npolice captain who had come to the hospital on official business. He assaulted that \\npolice officer but got the worst of it. In fact he got a broken jaw and lost some teeth. His friends took him out to the Corleone Fam ily houses at Long Beach. The following night \\nthe police captain he had the fight wit h was gunned down and Michael Corleone \\ndisappeared. Vanished. We have our contacts, our  informers. They all point the finger at \\nMichael Corleone but we have no evidence for a court of law. The waiter who witnessed \\nthe shooting doesn’t recognize a picture of Mi ke but he may recognize him in person. \\nAnd we have Sollozzo’s driver, who refuses to  talk, but we might make him talk if we \\nhave Michael Corleone in our hands. So we hav e all our people looking for him, the FBI \\nis looking for him, everybody is looking for hi m. So far, no luck, so  we thought you might  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 196\\nbe able to give us a lead.” \\nKay said coldly, “I don’t believe a word of i t.” But she felt a bit sick knowing the part \\nabout Mike getting his jaw broken must be true.  Not that that would make Mike commit \\nmurder. \\n“Will you let us know if Mike contacts you?” Phillips asked. \\nKay shook her head. The other detective, Siri ani, said roughly, “We know you two have \\nbeen shacking up together. We have the hotel records and witnesses. If we let that \\ninformation slip to the newspapers your father  and mother would feel pretty lousy. Real \\nrespectable people like them wouldn’t think much of a daughter shacking up with a \\ngangster. If you don’t come clean right now I’ll call your old man in here and give it to \\nhim straight.” \\nKay looked at him with astonishment. Then s he got up and went to t he door of the study \\nand opened it. She could see her father standing at the living-room window, sucking at \\nhis pipe. She called out, “Dad, can you join us ?” He turned, smiled at her, and walked to \\nthe study. When he came through the door he put his arm around his daughter’s waist \\nand faced the detectives and said, “Yes, gentlemen?” \\nWhen they didn’t answer, Kay said coolly to De tective Siriani, “Give it to him straight, \\nofficer.” \\nSiriani flushed. “Mr. Adams, I’m telling you this for your daughter’s good. She is mixed \\nup with a hoodlum we have reason to believe committed a murder on a police officer. \\nI’m just telling her she can get into seri ous trouble unless she cooperates with us. But \\nshe doesn’t seem to realize how serious this  whole matter is. May be you can talk to \\nher.” \\n“That is quite incredible,” Mr. Adams said politely. \\nSiriani jutted his jaw. “Your daughter and  Michael Corleone hav e been going out \\ntogether for over a year. They have stayed overnight in hotels together registered as \\nman and wife. Michael Corleo ne is wanted for questioning in  the murder of a police \\nofficer. Your daughter refuses to give us any information that may help us. Those are \\nthe facts. You can call them incredi ble but I can back everything up.” \\n“I don’t doubt your word, sir,” Mr. Adams said  gently. “What I find incr edible is that my \\ndaughter could be in serious trouble. Unless you’re suggesting that she is a”– here his \\nface became one of scholarly doubt– “a ‘moll,’ I believe it’s called.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 197\\nKay looked at her father in astonishment. She knew he was being playful in his donnish \\nway and she was surprised that he could take the whole affair so lightly. \\nMr. Adams said firmly, “However, rest assu red that if the young man shows his face \\nhere I shall immediately report his presence to  the authorities. As will my daughter. Now, \\nif you will forgive us, our lunch is growing cold.” \\nHe ushered the men out of the house with every courtesy and closed the door on their \\nbacks gently but firmly. He took Kay by the arm and led her toward the kitchen far in the \\nrear of the house, “Come,  my dear, your mother is  waiting lunch for us.” \\nBy the time they reached the kitchen, Kay was weeping silently, out of relief from strain, \\nat her father’s unquestioning a ffection. In the kitchen her mother took no notice of her \\nweeping, and Kay realiz ed that her father must have to ld her about the two detectives. \\nShe sat down at her place and  her mother served her silent ly. When all three were at \\nthe table her father sa id grace with bowed head. \\nMrs. Adams was a short stout woman always neatly dressed, hair always set. Kay had \\nnever seen her in disarray. Her mother too had always been a little di sinterested in her, \\nholding her at arm’s length. A nd she did so now. “Kay, stop being so dramatic. I’m sure \\nit’s all a great deal of fuss about  nothing at all. After all, the boy was a Dartmouth boy, \\nhe couldn’t possibly be mixed up in anything so sordid.” \\nKay looked up in surprise. “How did y ou know Mike went to Dartmouth?” \\nHer mother said complacently, “You young peopl e are so mysterious, you think you’re \\nso clever. We’ve known about him all along, but of course we couldn ’t bring it up until \\nyou did.” \\n“But how did you know?” Kay asked. She still couldn’t face her father now that he knew \\nabout her and Mike sleeping together. So she didn’t see the smile on his face when he \\nsaid, “We opened your mail, of course.” \\nKay was horrified and angry. Now she could face him. What he had done was more \\nshameful than her own sin. She could never believe it of him. “Father, you didn’t, you \\ncouldn’t have.” \\nMr. Adams smiled at her. “I debated which was the greater sin, opening your mail, or \\ngoing in ignorance of some hazard my only child might be incurring. The choice was \\nsimple, and virtuous.” \\nMrs. Adams said between mouthfuls of boiled chicken, “After all, my dear, you are  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 198\\nterribly innocent for your age. We had to be aware. And you never spoke about him.” \\nFor the first time Kay was grateful that Mic hael was never affectionate in his letters. She \\nwas grateful that her parents hadn’t seen some of her letters. “I never told you about him \\nbecause I thought you’d be horrified about his family.” \\n“We were,” Mr. Adams said cheerfully. “By the way, has Michael gotten in touch with \\nyou?” \\nKay shook her head. “I don’t believe he’s guilty of anything.” \\nShe saw her parents exchange a gl ance over the table. Then Mr. Adams said gently, “If \\nhe’s not guilty and he’s vanished, then perhaps something else happened to him.” \\nAt first Kay didn’t underst and. Then she got up from the table and ran to her room. \\n* * *  \\nThree days later Kay Adams got out of a ta xi in front of the Corleone mall in Long \\nBeach. She had phoned, she wa s expected. Tom Hagen met her at the door and she \\nwas disappointed that it was him. She knew he would tell her nothing. \\nIn the living room he gave her  a drink. She had seen a coup le of other men lounging \\naround the house but not Sonny. She asked To m Hagen directly, “Do you know where \\nMike is? Do you know where I can get in touch with him?” \\nHagen said smoothly, “We know he’s all right but we don’t know where he is right now. \\nWhen he heard about that captain being shot he was afraid they’d accuse him. So he \\njust decided to disappear. He told me he’d get in touch in a few months.” \\nThe story was not only false but meant to be seen through, he was giving her that much. “Did that captain really break his jaw?” Kay asked. \\n“I’m afraid that’s true,” Tom said. “But Mike  was never a vindictive man. I’m sure that \\nhad nothing to do with what happened.” \\nKay opened her purse and took out a letter. “W ill you deliver this to him if he gets in \\ntouch with you?” \\nHagen shook his head. “If I accepted that letter. and you told  a court of law I accepted \\nthat letter, it might be in terpreted as my having knowle dge of his w hereabouts. Why \\ndon’t you just wait a bit? I’m sure Mike will get in touch.” \\nShe finished her drink and got up to leave.  Hagen escorted her to the hall but as he \\nopened the door, a woman came in  from outside. A short, stout woman dressed in  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 199\\nblack. Kay recognized her as Michael’s mo ther. She held out her hand and said, “How \\nare you, Mrs. Corleone?” \\nThe woman’s small black eyes darted at her for a moment, then the wrinkled, leathery, \\nolive skinned face broke into a small curt smile of greeting that wa s yet in some curious \\nway truly friendly. “Ah, you Mikey’s little girl,” Mrs. Corleone said. She had a heavy \\nItalian accent, Kay could barely understand her. “You eat something?” Kay said no, \\nmeaning she didn’t want anything to eat, but  Mrs. Corleone turned furiously on Tom \\nHagen and berated him in Italian ending with, “You don’t even give this poor girl coffee, \\nyou disgrazia.” She took Kay by the hand, the old woman’s hand surprisingly warm and \\nalive, and led her in to the kitchen. “You have coffee an d eat something, then somebody \\ndrive you home. A nice girl like you, I don’t w ant you to take the train.” She made Kay sit \\ndown and bustled around the ki tchen, tearing off her coat and hat and draping them \\nover a chair. In a few seconds there wa s bread and cheese and salami on the table and \\ncoffee perking on the stove. \\nKay said timidly, “I came to ask about Mi ke, I haven’t heard from him. Mr. Hagen said \\nnobody knows where he is, that he’ll  turn up in a little while.” \\nHagen spoke quickly, “That’s all we can tell her now, Ma.” \\nMrs. Corleone gave him a look of withering cont empt. “Now you gonna tell me what to \\ndo? My husband don’t tell me what to do,  God have mercy on him.” She crossed \\nherself. \\n“Is Mr. Corleone all right?” Kay asked. \\n“Fine,” Mrs. Corleone said. “Fi ne. He’s getting old, he’s getti ng foolish to let something \\nlike that happen.” She tapped  her head disrespectfully. She poured the coffee and \\nforced Kay to eat some bread and cheese. \\nAfter they drank their coffee Mrs. Corleone took one of Kay’s hands in her two brown \\nones. She said quietly, “Mikey no gonna writ e you, you no gonna hear from Mikey. He \\nhide two– three years. Maybe more, maybe much more. You go home to your family and find a nice young fellow and get married.” \\nKay took the letter out of her pur se. “Will you send this to him?” \\nThe old lady took the letter and patted Kay on the cheek. “Sure, sure,” she said. Hagen \\nstarted to protest and she scr eamed at him in Italian. Then she led Kay to the door. \\nThere she kissed her on the cheek very quickly and said, “You forget about Mikey, he  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 200\\nno the man for you anymore.” \\nThere was a car waiting for her with two men up front. They drove her all the way to her \\nhotel in New York never saying a word. Neither  did Kay. She was trying to get used to \\nthe fact that the young m an she had loved was a coldbl ooded murderer. And that she \\nhad been told by the most unim peachable source: his mother. \\nChapter 16  \\nCarlo Rizzi was punk sore at the world. On ce married into the Corleone Family, he’d \\nbeen shunted aside with a sma ll bookmaker’s business on the Upper East Side of \\nManhattan. He’d count ed on one of the houses in the ma ll on Long Beach, he knew the \\nDon could move retainer families out when he pleased and he had been sure it would \\nhappen and he would be on the inside of everythi ng. But the Don wasn’t treating him \\nright. The “Great Don,” he thought with scorn. An old Moustache Pete who’d been \\ncaught out on the street by gunmen like any dumb small-time hood. He hoped the old bastard croaked. Sonny had been his friend once and if Sonny became the head of the \\nFamily maybe he’d get a break, get on the inside. \\nHe watched his wife pour his coffee. Chris t, what a mess she turned out to be. Five \\nmonths of marriage and she wa s already spreading, besides  blowing up. Real guinea \\nbroads all these Italians in the East. \\nHe reached out and felt Connie’s soft spre ading buttocks. She smiled at him and he said \\ncontemptuously, “You got more ham than a hog.” It pleased him to see the hurt look on \\nher face, the tears springing into her ey es. She might be a daughter of the Great Don \\nbut she was his wife, s he was his property now and he coul d treat her as he pleased. It \\nmade him feel powerful that one of the Corleones was his doormat. \\nHe had started her off just ri ght. She had tried to keep that purse full of money presents \\nfor herself and he had given her  a nice black eye and taken the money from her. Never \\ntold her what he’d done with it, either. That might have really caused some trouble. Even \\nnow he felt just the slightes t twinge of remorse. Christ, he’d blown nearly fifteen grand \\non the track and show girl bimbos. \\nHe could feel Connie watching his back and so he flexed his muscles as he reached for \\nthe plate of sweet buns on t he other side of t he table. He’d just polished off ham and \\neggs but he was a big man and needed a big break fast. He was pleased with the picture \\nhe knew he presented to his wife. Not the usual greasy dark guinzo husband but \\ncrew-cut blond, huge golden-haired forearms and broad shoulders and thin waist. And  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 201\\nhe knew he was physically stronger than any of those so-called hard guys that worked \\nfor the family. Guys like Clemenza, Tessio,  Rocco Lampone, and that  guy Paulie that \\nsomebody had knocked off. He wondered what the story was about that. Then for some \\nreason he thought about Sonny. Man to man he could take Sonny, he thought, even \\nthough Sonny was a little bigger and a little heav ier. But what scared him was Sonny’s \\nrep, though he himself had never seen Sonny  anything but good-natured and kidding \\naround. Yeah, Sonny was his bu ddy. Maybe with the old Don gone, things would open \\nup. \\nHe dawdled over his coffee. He hated this apartment. He wa s used to the bigger living \\nquarters of the West and in a li ttle while he would have to go crosstown to his “book” to \\nrun the noontime action. It was a Sunday, the heaviest action of the week, what with \\nbaseball going already and the ta il end of basketball and the ni ght trotters starting up. \\nGradually he became aware of Connie bustling around behind him and he turned his \\nhead to watch her. \\nShe was getting dressed up in the real New Yo rk City guinzo style that he hated. A silk \\nflowered-pattern dress with belt, showy brac elet and earrings, flouncy sleeves. She \\nlooked twenty years older. “Where t he hell are you going?” he asked. \\nShe, answered him coldly, “To see my father out  in Long Beach. He st ill can’t get out of \\nbed and he needs company.” \\nCarlo was curious. “Is Sonny  still running the show?” \\nConnie gave him a bland look. “What show?” \\nHe was furious. “You lousy little guinea bitch, don’t talk to me like that or I’ll beat that kid \\nright out of your belly.” She looked frightened and this enraged him even more. He \\nsprang from his chair and slapped her across the face, the blow leaving a red welt. With \\nquick precision he slapped her three more time s. He saw her upper lip split bloody and \\npuff up. That stopped him. He didn’t want to  leave a mark. She ran into the bedroom \\nand slammed the door and he heard the key turning in the lock. He laughed and \\nreturned to his coffee. \\nHe smoked until it was time for him to dress.  He knocked on the door  and said, “Open it \\nup before I kick it in.” There wa s no answer. “Come on, I gotta get dressed,” he said in a \\nloud voice. He could hear her getting up off the bed and coming toward the door, then \\nthe key turned in the lock. When he enter ed she had her back to him, walking back \\ntoward the bed, lying down on it with her face turned away to the wall.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 202\\nHe dressed quickly and then saw she was in her slip. He wanted her to go visit her \\nfather, he hoped she would brin g back information. “What’s t he matter, a few slaps take \\nall the energy out of you?” She was a lazy slut. \\n“I don’t wanna go.” Her voice was tearfu l, the words mumbled. He reached out \\nimpatiently and pulled her  around to face him. And then he saw why she didn’t want to \\ngo and thought maybe it was just as well. \\nHe must have slapped her harder than he fi gured. Her left cheek was blown up, the cut \\nupper lip ballooned grotesquely puffy  and white beneath her nose. “OK,” he said, “but I \\nwon’t be home until late. Sunday is my busy day.” \\nHe left the apartment and found a parking ticke t on his car, a fifteen-dollar green one. \\nHe put it in the glove compartment with t he stack of others. He was in a good humor. \\nSlapping the spoiled little bi tch around always made him feel  good. It dissolved some of \\nthe frustration he felt at being treated so badly by the Corleones. \\nThe first time he had marked her up, he’d been a little worried. She had gone right out to \\nLong Beach to complain to her mother and father and to show her black eye. He had \\nreally sweated it out. But when she ca me back she had been surprisingly meek, the \\ndutiful little Italian wife. He had made it a point to be the perfect husband over the next \\nfew weeks, treating her well in every way,  being lovey and nice with her, banging her \\nevery day, morning and night. Finally she had told him what had happened since she \\nthought he would never act that way again. \\nShe had found her parents coo lly unsympathetic and curiously amused. Her mother had \\nhad a little sympathy and had even asked her fat her to speak to Carlo Rizzi. Her father \\nhad refused. “She is my daughter,” he had said , “but now she belongs to her husband. \\nHe knows his duties. Even the King of Italy didn’t dare to meddle with the relationship of \\nhusband and wife. Go home and learn how to behave so that he will not beat you.” \\nConnie had said angrily to her  father, “Did you ever hit y our wife?” She was his favorite \\nand could speak to him so impudently. He had answered, “She never gave me reason \\nto beat her.” And her mo ther had nodded and smiled. \\nShe told them how her husband had taken the wedding present money and never told \\nher what he did with it. He r father had shrugged and said , “I would have done the same \\nif my wife had been as presumptuous as you.” \\nAnd so she had returned home, a tittle be wildered, a little frig htened. She had always \\nbeen her father’s favorite and she could not understand his coldness now.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 203\\nBut the Don had not been so un sympathetic as he pretended. He made inquiries and \\nfound out what Carlo Rizzi had done with the wedding present money. He had men \\nassigned to Carlo Rizzi’s bookmaking operati on who would report to  Hagen everything \\nRizzi did on the job. But the Don could not interfere. How expect a man to discharge his \\nhusbandly duties to a wife whos e family he feared? It was an  impossible situation and \\nhe dared not meddle. Then when Connie became pregnant he was convinced of the \\nwisdom of his decision and felt  he never could interfere t hough Connie complained to \\nher mother about a few more beatings and the mother finally became concerned \\nenough to mention it to the Don.  Connie even hinted that s he might want a divorce. For \\nthe first time in her life the Don was angry with her. “He is the father of your child. What \\ncan a child come to in this world if  he has no father?” he said to Connie. \\nLearning all this, Carlo Rizzi grew confident. He  was perfectly safe. In fact he bragged to \\nhis two “writers” on the book, Sally Rags and Coach, about how he bounced his wife \\naround when she got snotty and saw their loo ks of respect that he had the guts to \\nmanhandle the daughter of t he great Don Corleone. \\nBut Rizzi would not have felt so safe if he had known that  when Sonny Cotleone learned \\nof the beatings he had flown into a murderous rage and had been restrained only by the \\nsternest and most imperious command of the Don himself, a command that even Sonny \\ndared not disobey. Which was wh y Sonny avoided Rizzi, not trusting himself to control \\nhis temper. \\nSo feeling perfectly safe on this beautiful Sunday morning,  Carlo Rizzi sped crosstown \\non 96th Street to the East Side. He did not see Sonny’ s car coming the opposite way \\ntoward his house. \\n* * *  \\nSonny Corleone had left the prot ection of the mall and spent the night with Lucy Mancini \\nin town. Now on the way home  he was traveling with four bodyguards, two in front and \\ntwo behind. He didn’t need guards  right beside him, he could ta ke care of a single direct \\nassault. The other men traveled in their own cars and had apartments on either side of \\nLucy’s apartment. It was safe to visit her as  long as he didn’t do it too often. But now \\nthat he was in town he figured he would pick up his sister Connie and take her out to \\nLong Beach. He knew Carlo would be work ing at his book and the cheap bastard \\nwouldn’t get her a car. So he’ d give his sister a lift out. \\nHe waited for the two men in front to go in to the building and then  followed them. He  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 204\\nsaw the two men in back pull up behind his car and get out to watch the streets. He kept \\nhis own eyes open. It was a million-to-one shot  that the opposition even knew he was in \\ntown but he was always careful. He had learned that in the 1930’s war. \\nHe never used elevators. They were deat h traps. He climbed the eight flights to \\nConnie’s apartment, going fast. He knocked on her door. He had seen Carlo’s car go by \\nand knew she would be alone.  There was no answer. He knocked again and then he \\nheard his sister’s voice, frightened , timid, asking, “Who is it?” \\nThe fright in the voice stunned him. His kid sister had al ways been fresh and snotty, \\ntough as anybody in the family. What th e hell had happened to her? He said, “It’s \\nSonny.” The bolt inside slid back and the door opened and Connie was in his arms \\nsobbing. He was so surprised he just stood there. He pushed her away from him and \\nsaw her swollen face and he understood what had happened. \\nHe pulled away from her to run down the stairs and go after her husband. Rage flamed \\nup in him, contorting his own face. Connie saw the rage and clung to him, not letting him \\ngo, making him come into the apartment. She was weeping out of terror now. She knew \\nher older brother’s temper and feared it. S he had never complained to him about Carlo \\nfor that reason. Now she made him come into the apartment with her. \\n“It was my fault,” she said. “I  started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me. \\nHe really didn’t try to hit me that hard. I walked into it.” \\nSonny’s heavy Cupid face was under control.  “You going to see the old man today?” \\nShe didn’t answer, so he added, “I thought you were, so I dropped over to give you a lift. \\nI was in the city anyway.” \\nShe shook her head. “I don’t want them to see me this way. I’ll come next week.” \\n“OK,” Sonny said. He picked up her kitchen  phone and dialed a number. “I’m getting a \\ndoctor to come over here and take a look at  you and fix you up. In your condition you \\nhave to be careful. How many months before you have the kid?” \\n“Two months,” Connie said. “Sonny, pl ease don’t do anything. Please don’t.” \\nSonny laughed. His face was cruelly intent  when he said, “Don’t worry, I won’t make \\nyour kid an orphan before he’s born.” He le ft the apartment after ki ssing her lightly on \\nher uninjured cheek. \\n* * *   “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 205\\nOn East 112th Street a long li ne of cars were doubleparked in front of a candy store that \\nwas the headquarters of Carlo Rizz i’s book. On the sidewalk in front of the store, fathers \\nplayed catch with small children they had taken for a Sunday morning ride and to keep \\nthem company as they placed their bets. When they saw Carlo Rizzi coming they \\nstopped playing ball and bought their kids ice cream to keep them quiet. Then they \\nstarted studying the newspaper s that gave the starting pitchers, trying to pick out \\nwinning baseball bets for the day. \\nCarlo went into the large room  in the back of the store. His  two “writers,” a small wiry \\nman called Sally Rags and a big husky fellow ca lled Coach, were already waiting for the \\naction to start. They had their hu ge, lined pads in front of t hem ready to write down bets. \\nOn a wooden stand was a blackboard with the names of the sixte en big league baseball \\nteams chalked on it, paired to show who was playin g against who. Against each pairing \\nwas a blocked-out square to enter the odds. \\nCarlo asked Coach, “Is t he store phone t apped today?” \\nCoach shook his head. “The tap is still off.” \\nCarlo went to the wall phone and dialed a nu mber. Sally Rags and Coach watched him \\nimpassively as he jotted down the “line,” the odds on all the baseball games for that day. \\nThey watched him as he hung up the phone and walked over to the blackboard and \\nchalked up the odds against each game. Though Carlo did not know it, they had already \\ngotten the line and were checking his work. In  the first week in hi s job Carlo had made a \\nmistake in transposing the odds  onto the blackboard and had created that dream of all \\ngamblers, a “middle.” That is, by betting t he odds with him and th en betting against the \\nsame team with another bookmaker at the co rrect. odds, the gambler could not lose. \\nThe only one who coud lose was Carlo’s book. That mistake had caused a \\nsix-thousand-dollar loss in the book for the week and confirm ed the Don’s judgment \\nabout his son-in-law. He had given the word that  all of Carlo’s work was to be checked. \\nNormally the highly placed members of the Corleone Family would never be concerned \\nwith such an operational de tail. There was at least a five-lay er insulation to their level. \\nBut since the book was being used as a testi ng ground for the son-in -law, it had been \\nplaced under the direct scrutiny of Tom H agen, to whom a report was sent every day. \\nNow with the line posted, the ga mblers were thronging into the back room of the candy \\nstore to jot down the odds on their newspa pers next to the games printed there with \\nprobable pitchers. Some of them held their littl e children by the hand as they looked up  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 206\\nat the blackboard. One guy who made big bets looked down at the little girl he was \\nholding by the hand and sa id teasingly, “Who do you like  today, Honey, Giants or the \\nPirates?” The little girl, fascinated by the co lorful names, said, “Are Giants stronger than \\nPirates?” The father laughed. \\nA line began to form in front of the two writers. When a writer  filled one of his sheets he \\ntore it off, wrapped the money he had collected in it and handed it to Carlo. Carlo went \\nout the back exit of the room  and up a flight of steps to an apartment which housed the \\ncandy store owner’s family. He  called in the bets to his c entral exchange and put the \\nmoney in a small wall safe that was hidden by an extended window drape. Then he \\nwent back down into the candy store after having first burned the bet sheet and flushed \\nits ashes down the toilet bowl. \\nNone of the Sunday games started before two P.M. because of  the blue laws, so after \\nthe first crowd of bettors, family men who had to get their bets in and rush home to take \\ntheir families to the beach, came the trick ling of bachelor gambler s or the diehards who \\ncondemned their families to Sundays in the hot  city apartments. These bachelor bettors \\nwere the big gamblers, they  bet heavier and came back ar ound four o’clock to bet the \\nsecond games of doubleheaders.  They were the ones wh o made Carlo’s Sundays a \\nfull-time day with overtime, though some ma rried men called in from the beach to try \\nand recoup their losses. \\nBy one-thirty the betting had trickled off so that Carlo and Sally Rags could go out and sit on the stoop beside the candy store and get some fresh air. They watched the \\nstickball game the kids were having. A polic e car went by. They ignored it. This book \\nhad very heavy protection at the precinct and couldn’t be touched on a local level. A raid \\nwould have to be ordered from the very top and even then a warning would come \\nthrough in plenty of time. \\nCoach came out and sat beside them. They gossiped a while about baseball and \\nwomen. Carlo said laughingly , “I had to bat my wife around again today, teach her who’s \\nboss.” \\nCoach said casually, “She’s knocked up pretty big now, ain’t she?” \\n“Ahh, I just slapped her face a few times,” Carl o said. “I didn’t hurt her.” He brooded for \\na moment. “She thinks she can boss me  around, I don’t stand for that.” \\nThere were still a few bettors hanging around shooting the breeze, talking baseball, \\nsome of them sitting on the steps above the tw o writers and Carlo. Suddenly the kids  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 207\\nplaying stickball in t he street scattered. A car came scr eeching up the block and to a halt \\nin front of the candy store. It stopped so abruptly that the tires screamed and before it \\nhad stopped, almost, a man came hurtling out of the driver’s seat, moving so fast that \\neverybody was paralyzed. The man was Sonny Corleone. \\nHis heavy Cupid-featured face with its thick, curved mouth was an ugly mask of fury. In \\na split second he was at the stoop and had grabbed Carlo Rizzi by  the throat. He pulled \\nCarlo away from the others, trying to drag him into the street, but Carlo wrapped his \\nhuge muscular arms around the iron railings of the st oop and hung on. He cringed \\naway, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of his shoulder s. His shirt ripped \\naway in Sonny’s hand. \\nWhat followed then was sickening. Sonny began beating the cowering Carlo with his \\nfists, cursing him in a thick, rage-choked vo ice. Carlo, despite his tremendous physique, \\noffered no resistance, gave no cry for mercy or protest. Coach and Sally Rags dared not \\ninterfere. They thought Sonny meant to kill his brother-in-law and h ad no desire to share \\nhis fate. The kids playing stickball gather ed to curse the driver who had made them \\nscatter, but now were watching with awestru ck interest. They were tough kids but the \\nsight of Sonny in his rage silenced them . Meanwhile another ca r had drawn up behind \\nSonny’s and two of his bodyguards jum ped out. When they saw what was happening \\nthey too dared not interfere.  They stood alert, ready to protect their chief if any \\nbystanders had the stupidity to try to help Carlo. \\nWhat made the sight si ckening was Carlo’s complete subjec tion, but it was perhaps this \\nthat saved his life. He clung to the iron railings with his hands  so that Sonny could not \\ndrag him into the street and de spite his obvious equal strength, still refused to fight \\nback. He let the blows rain on his unprot ected head and neck until Sonny’s rage ebbed. \\nFinally, his chest heaving, Sonny looked down  at him and said, “You dirty bastard, you \\never beat up my sister again I’ll kill you.” \\nThese words released the tension. Because of course, if Sonny intended to kill the man \\nhe would never have uttered the threat. He utte red it in frustration because he could not \\ncarry it out. Carlo refused to look at S onny. He kept his head do wn and his hands and \\narms entwined in the iron railing. He stayed that way until the ca r roared off and he \\nheard Coach say in his curiously paternal voic e, “OK, Carlo, come on into the store. \\nLet’s get out of sight.” \\nIt was only then that Carlo dared  to get out of his crouch against the stone steps of the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 208\\nstoop and unlock his hands from the railing. Standing up, he c ould see the kids look at \\nhim with the staring, sickened faces of peop le who had witnessed the degradation of a \\nfellow human being. He was a littl e dizzy but if was more from shock, the raw fear that \\nhad taken command of his body;  he was not badly hurt despite  the shower of heavy \\nblows. He let Coach lead him by the arm into  the back room of the candy store and put \\nice on his face, which, though it was not cut or bleeding, was lumpy with swelling \\nbruises. The fear was subsiding now and the humiliation he had suffered made him sick \\nto his stomach so that he had to throw up. Coach held his head over the sink, supported \\nhim as if he were drunk, then helped him upstairs to the apartment and made him lie down in one of the bedrooms. Carlo never noticed that Sally Rags had disappeared. \\nSally Rags had walked down to Third Avenue and called Rocco Lampone to report what \\nhad happened. Rocco took the ne ws calmly and in his turn called his caporegime, Pete \\nClemenza. Clemenza groaned and said, “Oh, Christ, that goddamn Sonny and his \\ntemper,” but his finger had prudently clicked down on the hook so that Rocco never \\nheard his remark. \\nClemenza called the house in Long Beach and got Tom Hagen. Hagen was silent for a \\nmoment and then he said, “Send some of your  people and cars out on the road to Long \\nBeach as soon as you can, just in case S onny gets held up by traffic or an accident. \\nWhen he gets sore like that he doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing. Maybe some of our friends on the other side will hear he was in town. You sever can tell.” \\nClemenza said doubtfully, “By the time I c ould get anybody on the road, Sonny will be \\nhome. That goes for the Tattaglias too.” \\n“I know,” Hagen said patiently . “But if something out of  the ordinary happens, Sonny \\nmay be held up. Do the best you can, Pete.” \\nGrudgingly Clemenza called Rocco Lampone and told him to get  a few people and cars \\nand cover the road to Long Beach. He himself went out to his beloved Cadillac and with \\nthree of the platoon of guards  who now garrisoned his home, started over the Atlantic \\nBeach Bridge, toward New York City. \\nOne of the hangers-on around t he candy store, a small bettor on the payroll of the \\nTattaglia Family as an informer, called the contact he had with his people. But the Tattaglia Family had not stream lined itself for the war, the contact still had to go all the \\nway through the insulation laye rs before he finally got to the caporegime, who contacted \\nthe Tattaglia chief. By that time Sonny Co rleone was safely back in the mall, in his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 209\\nfather’s house, in Long Beach, about to face his father’s wrath. \\nChapter 17  \\nThe war of 1947 between the Co rleone Family and the Five Fa milies combined against \\nthem proved to be expensive for both sides. It  was complicated by the police pressure \\nput on everybody to solve the murder of C aptain McCluskey. It was rare that operating \\nofficials of the Police Depar tment ignored political muscle that protected gambling and \\nvice operations, but in this case the politicia ns were as helpless as the general staff of a \\nrampaging, looting army whose field officers refuse to follow orders. \\nThis lack of protection did not hurt the Corleone Family as much as it did their \\nopponents. The Corleone group depended on gambling for most of its income, and was \\nhit especially hard in its “numbers” or “policy” branch of operations. The runners who \\npicked up the action were swept into police nets and usually given a medium shellacking \\nbefore being booked. Even some  of the “banks” were loca ted and raided, with heavy \\nfinancial loss. The “bankers,” .90 calibers in their own right, complained to the \\ncaporegimes, who brought their complaints to the family council table. But there was \\nnothing to be done. The bankers were told  to go out of business. Local Negro \\nfree-lancers were allowed to take over the operation in Harlem, the richest territory, and \\nthey operated in such scattered fashion that the police found it hard to pin them down. \\nAfter the death of Captain McCluskey, some newspapers printed st ories involving him \\nwith Sollozzo. They published proof that Mc Cluskey had received large sums of money \\nin cash, shortly before his death. These stories had been planted by Hagen, the information supplied by him. The Police De partment refused to confirm or deny these \\nstories, but they were taking effect. The police force got the word through informers, through police on the Family payroll, that McCluskey had been a rogue cop. Not that he \\nhad taken money or clean graft, there was no r ank-and-file onus to that. But that he had \\ntaken the dirtiest of dirty money; murder  and drugs money. And in the morality of \\npolicemen, this was unforgivable. \\nHagen understood that the policeman believes in law and order in a curiously innocent way. He believes in it more than does the public he serves. Law and order is, after all, \\nthe magic from which he derives  his power, individual power which he cherishes as \\nnearly all men cherish indi vidual power. And yet there is always the smoldering \\nresentment against the public he serves. They are at the same time his ward and his \\nprey. As wards they are ungrateful, abusive and demanding. As prey they are slippery  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 210\\nand dangerous, full of gui le. As soon as one is in the policeman’s clutches the \\nmechanism of the society the policeman defends  marshals all its resources to cheat him \\nof his prize. The fix is put in by politic ians. Judges give lenient suspended sentences to \\nthe worst hoodlums. Governors of the States and the Presid ent of the United States \\nhimself give full pardons, assuming that res pected lawyers have not already won his \\nacquittal. After a time the cop learns. Why should he not collect the fees these hoodlums \\nare paying? He needs it more. His children , why should they not go to college? Why \\nshouldn’t his wife shop in more expensive pl aces? Why shouldn’t be himself get the sun \\nwith a winter vacation in Florida? After all, he risks his life and that is no joke. \\nBut usually he draws the line ag ainst accepting dirty graft. He will take money to let a \\nbookmaker operate. He will take  money from a man who hates  getting parking tickets or \\nspeeding tickets. He will allo w call girls and prostitutes to ply their trade; for a \\nconsideration. These are vices natural to a m an. But usually he will not take a payoff for \\ndrugs, armed robberies, rape, murder and other assorted perve rsions. In his mind these \\nattack the very core of his persona l authority and cannot be countenanced. \\nThe murder of a police captain was comparabl e to regicide. But when it became known \\nthat McCluskey had been ki lled while in the company of a notorious narcotics peddler, \\nwhen it became known that he was suspected of conspiracy to murder, the police desire \\nfor vengeance began to fade. Also, after all, there were still mortgage payments to be \\nmade, cars to be paid off, children to be l aunched into the world. Without their “sheet” \\nmoney, policemen had to scramble to make ends meet. Unlicensed peddlers were good \\nfor lunch money. Parking ticket payoffs came to nickels and dimes. Some of the more \\ndesperate even began shaking dow n suspects (homosexuals, assaults and batteries) in \\nthe precinct squad rooms. Finally the brass re lented. They raised the prices and let the \\nFamilies operate. Once again the payoff sheet was typed up by the precinct bagman, \\nlisting every man assigned to the local station and what his cut was each month. Some \\nsemblance of social order was restored. \\n* * *  \\nIt had been Hagen’s idea to use private detectives to guard Don Corleone’s hospital room. These were, of course, supplemented by  the much more formidable soldiers of \\nTessio’s regime. But Sonny was not satisfied even with this. By the middle of February, \\nwhen the Don could be mov ed without danger, he was taken by ambulance to his home \\nin the mall. The house had been renovated so that his bedroom was now a hospital \\nroom with all equipment necessary for any emergency. Nurses specially recruited and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 211\\nchecked had been hired for r ound-the-clock care, and Dr. K ennedy, with the payment of \\na huge fee, had been persuaded to become the physician in residence to this private \\nhospital. At least until the D on would need only nursing care. \\nThe mall itself was made im pregnable. Button men were moved into the extra houses, \\nthe tenants sent on vacations to their nativ e villages in Italy, all expenses paid. \\nFreddie Corleone had been sent to Las Vegas to  recuperate and also to scout out the \\nground for a Family operation in the luxury hotel-gambling casino complex that was \\nspringing up. Las Vegas was part of the West Coast empire still neutral and the Don of \\nthat empire had guaranteed Freddie’s safety t here. The New York fi ve Families had no \\ndesire to make more enemies by going into  Vegas after Freddie Corleone. They had \\nenough trouble on their hands in New York. \\nDr. Kennedy had forbade any discussion of busine ss in front of the D on. This edict was \\ncompletely disregarded. The Don insisted on the council of war being held in his room. \\nSonny, Tom Hagen, Pete Clemenza and Tessio gathe red there the very first night of his \\nhomecoming. \\nDon Corleone was too weak to speak much but he wished to listen and exercise veto \\npowers. When it was explained  that Freddie had been sent to Las Vegas to learn the \\ngambling casino business he nodded his head appr ovingly. When he learned that Bruno \\nTattaglia had been killed by Corleone butt on men he shook his head and sighed. But \\nwhat distressed him most of  all was learning that Michael had killed Sollozzo and \\nCaptain McCluskey and had then been forced to  flee to Sicily. When he heard this he \\nmotioned them out and they continued the conf erence in the corner room that held the \\nlaw library. \\nSonny Corleone relaxed in the huge armchair behind the desk.  “I think we’d better let \\nthe old man take it easy for a couple of we eks, until the doc says he can do business.” \\nHe paused. “I’d like to have it going again be fore he gets better. We have the go-ahead \\nfrom the cops to operate. The first thing is the policy banks in Harlem. The black boys \\nup there had their fun, now we have to take it back. They screwed up the works but \\ngood, just like they usually do when they run things. A lot of  their runners didn’t pay off \\nwinners. They drive up in Cadillacs and tell their players they gotta wait for their dough or maybe just pay them half what they win. I don’t want any runner looking rich to his \\nplayers. I don’t want them dressing too good . I don’t want them driving new cars. I don’t \\nwant them welching on paying a winner. And I don’t want any free-lancers staying in  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 212\\nbusiness, they give us a bad name. Tom, let’s get that project moving right away. \\nEverything else will fall in line as soon as you send out the word that the lid is off.” \\nHagen said, “There are some very tough boys up in Harlem. They got a taste of the big \\nmoney. They won’t go back to being runners or sub-bankers again.” \\nSonny shrugged. “Just give their names to Cle menza. That’s his j ob, straightening them \\nout.” \\nClemenza said to Hagen, “No problem.” \\nIt was Tessio wbo brought up the most important question. “Once we start operating, the five Families start their raids. They’ll hit our bankers in Harlem and out bookmakers on \\nthe East Side. They may even try to make th ings tough for the garment  center outfits we \\nservice. This war is going to cost a lot of money.” \\n“Mabe they won’t,” Sonny said. “They know we’ll hit them right back. I’ve got peace \\nfeelers out and maybe we can se ttle everything by paying an indemnity for the Tattaglia \\nkid.” \\nHagen said, “We’re getting the co ld shoulder on those negotiations. They lost a lot of \\ndough the last few months and t hey blame us for it. With justice. I think what they want \\nis for us to agree to come in on the narcotics trade, to use the Family influence \\npolitically. In other words, Sollozzo’s deal minus Sollozzo. But they won’t broach that \\nuntil they’ve hurt us with some sort of com bat action. Then after we’ve been softened up \\nthey figure we’ll listen to  a proposition on narcotic.” \\nSonny said curtly, “No deal on drugs. The D on said no and it’s no until he changes it.” \\nHagen said briskly, “Then we’re faced with a ta ctical problem. Our money is out in the \\nopen. Bookmaking and policy. We can be hit. Bu t the Tattaglia Family has prostitution \\nand call girls and the dock un ions. How the hell are we go ing to hit them? The other \\nFamilies are in some gambling. But most of them are in the construction trades, \\nshylocking, controlling the unions, getting the gov ernment contracts. T hey get a lot from \\nstrong-arm and other stuff that involves innocent people. Th eir money isn’t out in the \\nstreet. The Tattaglia nightclub is too famous to touch it, it would cause too much of a \\nstink. And with the Don still out of action their political influence matches ours. So we’ve \\ngot a real problem here.” \\n“It’s my problem, Tom,” Sonny said. “I’ll fi nd the answer. Keep the negotiation alive and \\nfollow through on the other stuff. Let’s go back into business and see what happens.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 213\\nThen we’ll take it from ther e. Clemenza and Tessio have plenty of soldiers, we can \\nmatch the whole Five Families gun for gun if t hat’s the way they want it. We’ll just go to \\nthe mattresses.” \\nThere was no problem getting the free-lance N egro bankers out of business. The police \\nwere informed and cracked down. With a special effort. At that time  it was not possible \\nfor a Negro to make a payoff to a high polic e or political official to keep such an \\noperation going. This was due to racial prejudice and racial  distrust more than anything \\nelse. But Harlem had always been consider ed a minor problem, and its settlement was \\nexpected. \\nThe Five Families struck in an unexpected di rection. Two powerful officials in the \\ngarment unions were killed, officials who we re members of the Corleone Family. Then \\nthe Corleone Family shylocks were barred from the waterfront piers as were the \\nCorleone Family bookmakers. The longshorem en’s union locals ha d gone over to the \\nFive Families. Corleone bookmakers all over the city were threatened to persuade them \\nto change their allegiance. The biggest numbers banker in Harlem, an old friend and ally \\nof the Corleone Family, was brutally murdered.  There was no longer  any option. Sonny \\ntold his caporegimes to  go to the mattresses. \\nTwo apartments were set up in the city and furnished with mattresse s for the button men \\nto sleep on, a refrigerator for food, and guns and ammunition. Clemenza staffed one \\napartment and Tessio the other. All Family bookmakers were given bodyguard teams. \\nThe policy bankers in Harlem, however, had gone over to t he enemy and at the moment \\nnothing could be done about that. All this co st the Corleone Family  a great deal of \\nmoney and very little was coming in. As t he next few months went by, other things \\nbecame obvious. The most important was t hat the Corleone Family had overmatched \\nitself. \\nThere were reasons for this. With the Don st ill too weak to take a part, a great deal of \\nthe Family’s political strengt h was neutralized. Also, the last ten years of peace had \\nseriously eroded the fighting qualities of the two caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio. \\nClemenza was still a competent executioner and administrator but he no longer had the \\nenergy or the youthful str ength to lead troops. Tessio had mellowed with age and was \\nnot ruthless enough. Tom Hagen, despite his ab ilities, was simply not suited to be a \\nConsigliere in a time of war. His main  fault was that he was not a Sicilian. \\nSonny Corleone recognized these weaknesses in the Family’s wartime posture but  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 214\\ncould not take any steps to remedy them. He was not the Don a nd only the Don could \\nreplace the caporegimes and the Consigliere. And the very act of replacement would \\nmake the situation more dangerous, might prec ipitate some treachery. At first, Sonny \\nhad thought of fighting a holding action until t he Don could become well enough to take \\ncharge, but with the defection of the policy bankers, the terrorization of the bookmakers, \\nthe Family position was becoming precarious. He decided to strike back. \\nBut he decided to strike right at the heart of the enemy. He planned the execution of the \\nheads of the five Families in one grand tact ical maneuver. To that purpose he put into \\neffect an elaborate system of surveillance of these leaders. But after a week the enemy chiefs promptly, dived underground and were seen no more in public. \\nThe Five Families and the Corleone Empire were in stalemate. \\nChapter 18   \\nAmerigo Bonasera lived only a few blo cks from his undertaki ng establishment on \\nMulberry Street and so always went home for supper. Evenings he returned to his place \\nof business, dutifully joining those mourners paying their respects to the dead who lay in \\nstate in his somber parlors. \\nHe always resented the jokes made about his profession, t he macabre technical details \\nwhich were so unimportant. Of course none of his friends or family or neighbors would \\nmake such jokes. Any profession was wort hy of respect to men who for centuries \\nearned bread by the sweat of their brows. \\nNow at supper with his wife in their solidly furnished apartment, gilt statues of the Virgin \\nMary with their red-glassed candles flicke ring on the sideboard, Bonasera lit a Camel \\ncigarette and took a relaxing glass of Am erican whiskey. His wife brought steaming \\nplates of soup to the table. The two of them were alone now; he had sent his daughter \\nto live in Boston with her mother ’s sister, where she could fo rget her terrible experience \\nand her injuries at the hands of the two ruffians Don Corleone had punished. \\nAs they ate their soup his wife asked, “Are you going back to  work tonight?” \\nAmerigo Bonasera nodded. His wife respected his work but did not understand it. She \\ndid not understand that the technical part of  his profession was the least important. She \\nthought, like most other people, t hat he was paid for his skill in  making the dead look so \\nlifelike in their coffins. And indeed his sk ill in this was legendary. But even more \\nimportant, even more necessary was his physical presence at the wake. When the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 215\\nbereaved family came at night to receive t heir blood relatives and their friends beside \\nthe coffin of their loved one, they  needed Amerigo Bonasera with them. \\nFor he was a strict chaperone to death. His face always grave, yet strong and \\ncomforting, his voice unwavering, yet mut ed to a low register, he commanded the \\nmourning ritual. He could quiet grief that was too unseemly, he could rebuke unruly \\nchildren whose parents had not the heart to chastise. Never cl oying in the tender of his \\ncondolences, yet never was he offhand. On ce a family used Amerigo Bonasera to \\nspeed a loved one on, they ca me back to him again and ag ain. And he never, never, \\ndeserted one of his clients on that terrible last night above ground. \\nUsually he allowed himself a little nap a fter supper. Then he washed and shaved afresh, \\ntalcum powder generously used to shroud t he heavy black beard. A mouthwash always. \\nHe respectfully changed into fresh linen, white gleaming shirt, the black tie, a freshly \\npressed dark suit, dull black shoes and black socks. And yet the effect was comforting \\ninstead of somber. He also kept his hair dy ed black, an unheard-of frivolity in an Italian \\nmale of his generation; but not out of vani ty. Simply because his hair had turned a lively \\npepper and salt, a color which struck hi m as unseemly for his profession. \\nAfter he finished his soup, his wife placed a sm all steak before him wit h a few forkfuls of \\ngreen spinach oozing yellow oil. He was a light eater. When he finished this he drank a cup of coffee and smoked another Camel cigare tte. Over his coffee he thought about his \\npoor daughter. She would never be the same . Her outward beauty had been restored \\nbut there was the look of a frightened animal in her eyes that had made him unable to \\nbear the sight of her. And so they had sent her to live in Boston for a time. Time would \\nheal her wounds. Pain and terror was not so final  as death, as he well knew. His work \\nmade him an optimist. \\nHe had just finished the co ffee when his phone in the livin g room rang. His wife never \\nanswered it when he was home, so he got  up and drained his cu p and stubbed out his \\ncigarette. As he walked to the phone he pull ed off his tie and started to unbutton his \\nshirt, getting ready for his little nap. Then he picked up the phone and said with quiet courtesy, “Hello.” \\nThe voice on the other end was harsh, strained. “This is Tom Hagen,” it said. “I’m calling \\nfor Don Corleone, at his request.” \\nAmerigo Bonasera felt the coffee churning sour ly in his stomach, felt himself going a \\nlittle sick. It was more than a year since he had put himself in the debt of the Don to  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 216\\navenge his daughter’s honor and in that time t he knowledge that he mu st pay that debt \\nhad receded. He had been so gratef ul seeing the bloody faces of those two ruffians that \\nhe would have done anything for the Don. But time erodes gratitude more quickly than it \\ndoes beauty. Now Bonasera felt the sickness of a man faced with disaster. His voice \\nfaltered as he answered, “Yes , I understand. I’m listening.” \\nHe was surprised at the coldness in Hagen’ s voice. The Consigli ere had always been a \\ncourteous man, though not Italian, but now he was being r udely brusque. “You owe the \\nDon a service,” Hagen said. “He has no doubt that you will repay him. That you will be \\nhappy to have this opportunity. In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your \\nfuneral parlor to ask for your help. Be t here to greet him. D on’t have any people who \\nwork for you there. Send them home. If you have any objections to this, speak now and \\nI’ll inform Don Corleone. He has other friends who can do him this service.” \\nAmerigo Bonasera almost cried out in his fright, “How can you think I would refuse the \\nGodfather? Of course I’ll do any thing he wishes. I haven’t forgo tten my debt. I’ll go to my \\nbusiness immediately, at once.” \\nHagen’s voice was gentler now , but there was something strange about it. “Thank you,” \\nhe said “The Don never doubted you. The question was mine. Oblige him tonight and \\nyou can always come to me in any troubl e, you’ll earn my personal friendship.” \\nThis frightened Amerigo Bonasera even more. He stuttered, “The Don himself is coming \\nto me tonight?” \\n“Yes,” Hagen said. \\n“Then he’s completely recovered from his inju ries, thank God,” Bonasera said. His voice \\nmade it a question. \\nThere was a pause at the other end of the phone, t hen Hagen’s voice sa id very quietly, \\n“Yes.” There was a click and the phone went dead. \\nBonasera was sweating. He went into the bedroom and changed his shirt and rinsed his \\nmouth. But he didn’t shave or  use a fresh tie. He put on the same one he had used \\nduring the day. He called the funeral parlor and told his assistant to stay with the \\nbereaved family using the front  parlor that night. He himself would be busy in the \\nlaboratory working area of t he building. When the assist ant started asking question \\nBonesera cut him off very curtly and told him to follow orders exactly. \\nHe put on his suit jacket and his wife, still eati ng, looked up at him in surprise. “I have  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 217\\nwork to do,” he said and she did not dare q uestion him because of the look on his face. \\nBonasera went out of the house and walked the few blocks to his funeral parlor. \\nThis building stood by it self on a large lot wit h a white picket fence running all around it. \\nThere was a narrow roadway leading from t he street to the rear , just wide enough for \\nambulances and hearses. Bonasera unlocked t he gate and left it open. Then he walked \\nto the rear of the bu ilding and entered it through the wide door there. As he did so he \\ncould see mourners already en tering the front door of the funeral parlor to pay their \\nrespects to the current corpse. \\nMany years ago when Bonasgra had bought this building from an undertaker planning to \\nretire, there had been a stoop  of about ten steps that m ourners had to mount before \\nentering the funeral parlor. This had pos ed a problem. Old and crippled mourners \\ndetermined to pay their respects had found the steps almost impossible to mount, so the \\nformer undertaker had used the freight elevator  for these people, a small metal platform, \\nthat rose out of the ground bes ide the building. The elevator was for coffins and bodies. \\nIt would descend underground, then rise into the funeral parlor itself, so that a crippled \\nmourner would find himself rising through the floor beside the coffin as other mourners \\nmoved their black chairs aside to let the elevator rise throngh the trapdoor. Then when \\nthe crippled or aged mourner had finished paying his respects, the elevator would again \\ncome up through the polished floor to take him down and out again. \\nAmerigo Bonasera had found this soluti on to the problem upseernly and \\npenny-pinching. So he had had the front of th e building remodeled, the stoop done away \\nwith and a slightly inclining walk put in its pl ace. But of course the elevator was still used \\nfor coffins and corpses. \\nIn the rear of the building, cut off from the funeral parlor and reception rooms by a \\nmassive soundproof door, was t he business office, the emba lming room, a storeroom \\nfor coffins, and a carefully locked closet hold ing chemicals and the awful tools of his \\ntrade. Bonasera went to the office, sat at his desk and lit up a Camel,,one of the few \\ntimes he had ever smoked in this build ing. Then he waited for Don Corleone. \\nHe waited with a feeling of the utmost despair. For, he had no doubt as to what services \\nhe would be called upon to perform. For the last year the Corleone Family had waged \\nwar against the five great Mafia Families of New York and the carnage had filled the \\nnewspapers. Many men on both sides had been killed. Now the Corleone Family had \\nkilled somebody so important that they wished to hide his body, make it disappear, and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 218\\nwhat better way than to have it officially bur ied by a registered un dertaker? And Amerigo \\nBonasera had no illusions  about the act he was to commit. He would be an accessory to \\nmurder. If it came out, he would spend years in jail. His daughter and wife would be \\ndisgraced, his good name, the respected name of Amerigo Bonasera, dragged through \\nthe bloody, mud of the Mafia war. \\nHe indulged himself by smoking another Camel. And then he thought of something even more terrifying. When the other Mafia Families found out  that he had aided the \\nCorleones they would treat him as an enemy. They would murder him. And now he \\ncursed the day he had gone to the Godfather and begged for his vengeance. He cursed \\nthe day his wife and the wif e of Don Corleone had become friends. He cursed his \\ndaughter and America and his own success. And then his optimism returned. It could all \\ngo well. Don Corleone was a clever man. Certainly everything had been arranged to \\nkeep the secret. He had only to keep his nerv e. For of course the one thing more fatal \\nthan any other was to earn the Don’s displeasure. \\nHe heard tires on gravel. His practiced ear told him a car was coming through the \\nnarrow driveway and parking in the back yard. He opened the rear door to let them in. \\nThe huge fat man, Clemenza, entered, follo wed by two very rough-looking young \\nfellows. They searched the rooms without sa ying a word to Bonasera, then clemenza \\nwent out. The two young men remained with the undertaker. \\nA few moments later Bonasera recognized the sound of a heavy ambulance coming \\nthrough the narrow driveway. Then Clemenza app eared in the doorwa y followed by two \\nmen carrying a stretcher. And Amerigo Bonaser a’s worst fears were realized. On the \\nstretcher was a corpse swaddled in a gray blanket but with bare ye llow feet sticking out \\nthe end. \\nClemenza motioned the stretcher-bearers into the embalming room. And then from the \\nblackness of the yard another  man stepped into the light ed office room. It was Don \\nCorleone. \\nThe Don had lost weight during his illness and moved with a curious stiffness. He was \\nholding his hat in his hands and his hair seemed thin over his massive skull. He looked \\nolder, more shrunken than when Bonasera had  seen him at the wedding, but he still \\nradiated power. Holding his hat against his ches t, he said to Bonasera, “Well, old friend, \\nare you ready to do me this service?” \\nBonasera nodded. The Don followed the stre tcher into the embalming room and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 219\\nBonasera trailed after him. The corpse was on one of the guttered tables. Don Corleone \\nmade a tiny gesture with his hat and the other men left the room. \\nBonasera whispered, “What do you wish me to do?” \\nDon Corleone was staring at the table. “I want you to use al l your powers, all your skill, \\nas you love me,” he said. “I do not wish his mot her to see him as he is.” He went to the \\ntable and drew down the gray blanket. Ameri go Bonasera against all his will, against all \\nhis years of training and exper ience, let out a gasp of horro r. On the embalming able \\nwas the bullet-smashed face of Sonny Co rleone. The left eye drowned in blood had a \\nstar fracture in its lens. The bridge of his nose and left cheekbone were hammered into \\nPulp. \\nFor one fraction of a second the Don pu t out his hand to support himself against \\nBonasera’s body. “See how they have massacred my son,” he said. \\nChapter 19 \\nPerhaps it was the stalemat e that made Sonny Corleone embark on the bloody course \\nof attrition that ended in his ow n death. Perhaps it was his dar k violent nature given full \\nrein. \\nIn any case, that spring and summer he mount s senseless raids on enemy auxiliaries. \\nTattaglia Family pimps were shot to death in Harlem, dock goons were massacred. \\nUnion officials who owed allegiance to the Fi ve Families were warned to stay neutral, \\nand when the Corleone bookmakers and shylocks were still barred from the docks, \\nSonny sent Clemenza and his regime to wreak havoc upon the long shore. \\nThis slaughter was senseless because it could not affect affect the outcome of the war. \\nSonny was a brilliant tactician and wears his brilliant victories. But what was needed \\nwas the strategical genius of Don Corleone. The whole thing degenerated into such a \\ndeadly guerrilla war that both sides found them selves losing a great deal of revenue and \\nlives to no purpose. The Corleone Family was finally forced to close down some of its \\nmost profitable bookmaking stations, including the book given to son-in-law Carlo Rizzi \\nfor his living. Carlo took to drink and running with chorus girls and gi ving his wife Connie \\na hard time. Since his beating at the hands of Sonny he had not dared to hit his wife \\nagain but he had not slept with her. Connie had thrown hers elf at his feet and he had \\nspurned her, as he thought, like a Roman, wit h exquisite patrician pleasure. He had \\nsneered at her, “Go call your br other and tell him I won’t screw  you, maybe he’ll beat me \\nup until I get a hard on.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 220\\nBut he was in deadly fear of Sonny though they treated each other with cold politeness. \\nCarlo had the sense to realiz e that Sonny would kill him,  that Sonny was a man who \\ncould, with the naturalness of an animal, kill another man, while he himself would have \\nto call up all his courage, all his will, to commit murder. It never occurred to Carlo that \\nbecause of this he was a better man than Sonny  Corleone, if such terms could be used; \\nhe envied Sonny his awesome savagery, a savagery which was now becoming a legend. \\nTom Hagen, as the Consigliere , disapproved of Sonny’s ta ctics and yet decided not to \\nprotest to the Don simply because the tact ics, to some extent, worked. The Five \\nFamilies seemed to be cowed, finally, as t he attrition went on, and their counterblows \\nweakened and finally ceased altogether. Hagen at first distrusted this seeming \\npacification of the enemy but Sonny was jubilant. “I’ll pour it on,” he told Hagen, “and \\nthen those bastards will come begging for a deal.” \\nSonny was worried about other things. His wife was giving him a hard time because the \\nrumors had gotten to her that Lucy Manc ini had bewitched her husband. And though \\nshe joked publicly about her Sonny’s equipment and technique, he had stayed away \\nfrom her too long and she missed him in her  bed, and she was making life miserable for \\nhim with her nagging. \\nIn addition to this Sonny was under the enorm ous strain of being a marked man. He had \\nto be extraordinarily careful in all his move ments and he knew that his visits to Lucy \\nMancini had been charted by the enemy. But here he took elaborate precautions since \\nthis was the traditional vulnerable spot. He was safe there. Though Lucy had not the \\nslightest suspicion, she was watched twenty-four hours a day by men of the Santino regime and when an apartment became vacant on her floor it was immediately rented \\nby one of the most reliable men of that regime. \\nThe Don was recovering and would soon be able to resume command. At that time the \\ntide of battle must swing to the Corleone Fam ily. This Sonny was sure of. Meanwhile he \\nwould guard his Family’s empire, earn the res pect of his father, and, since the position \\nwas not hereditary to an absolute degree, cem ent his claim as heir to the Corleone \\nEmpire. \\nBut the enemy was making its plans. They t oo had analyzed the sit uation and had come \\nto the conclusion that the only way to st ave off complete defeat was to kill Sonny \\nCorleone. They understood the situation better now and felt it was possible to negotiate  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 221\\nwith the Don, known for his lo gical reasonableness. They ha d come to hate Sonny for \\nhis bloodthirstiness, which they considered  barbaric. Also not good business sense. \\nNobody wanted the old days back again with all its turmoil and trouble. \\nOne evening Connie Corleone re ceived an anonymous phone call, a girl’s voice, asking \\nfor Carlo. “Who is this?” Connie asked. \\nThe girl on the other end giggled and said, “I’m a friend of Carlo’s. I just wanted to tell \\nhim I can’t see him tonight. I have to go out of town.” \\n“You lousy bitch,” Connie Corleone said. She screamed it again into the phone. “You \\nlousy tramp bitch.” There was a click on the other end. \\nCarlo had gone to the track for that afternoon and when he came home in the late \\nevening he was sore at losing and half drun k from the bottle he a lways carried. As soon \\nas he stepped into the door, Connie started screaming curses  at him. He ignored her \\nand went in to take a shower. When he came out he dried his naked b ody in front of her \\nand started dolling up to go out. \\nConnie stood with hands on hips, her face pointy and white wi th rage. “You’re not going \\nanyplace,” she said. “Your girl  friend called and said she can’t make it tonight. You lousy \\nbastard, you have the nerve to give your whores my phone number. I’ll kill you, you \\nbastard.” She rushed at him, kicking and scratching. \\nHe held her off with one muscular forearm. “You’ re crazy,” he said coldly. But she could \\nsee he was worried, as if he knew the cra zy girl he was screwing would actually pull \\nsuch a stunt. “She was kidding ar ound, some nut,” Carlo said. \\nConnie ducked around his arm and clawed at his face. She got a little bit of his cheek under her fingernails. With surprising patience he pushed her away. She noticed he was \\ncareful because of her pregnancy and that gave her the courage to feed her rage. She \\nwas also excited. Pretty soon she wouldn’t be able to do anything, the doctor had said \\nno sex for the last two months and she wanted it, before the last two months started. Yet \\nher wish to inflict a physical injury on Carlo wa s very real too. She followed him into the \\nbedroom. \\nShe could see he was scared and that fill ed her with contemptuous delight. “You’re \\nstaying home,” she said, “you’re not going out.” \\n“OK, OK,” he said. He was still undressed,  only wearing his shorts. He liked to go \\naround the house like that, he wa s proud of his V-shaped body, the golden skin. Connie  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 222\\nlooked at him hungrily. He tried to laugh. “You gonna give me something to eat at \\nleast?” \\nThat mollified her, his calli ng on her duties, one of them at least. She was a good cook, \\nshe had learned that from her mother. She sauteed v eal and peppers, preparing a \\nmixed salad while the pan simmered. Meanwhi le Carlo stretched out on his bed to read \\nthe next day’s racing form. He had a water glass full of whiskey beside him which he \\nkept sipping at. \\nConnie came into the bedroom . She stood in the doorway as if she could not come \\nclose to the bed without being invited. “The food is on the table,” she said. \\n“I’m not hungry yet,” he said, still reading the racing form. \\n“It’s on the table,” Connie said stubbornly. \\n“Stick it up your ass,” Carlo said . He drank off the rest of the whiskey in the water glass, \\ntilted the bottle to fill it again. He paid no more attention to her. \\nConnie went into the kitchen, picked up t he plates filled with food and smashed them \\nagainst the sink. The loud crashes brought Carl o in from the bedroom. He looked at the \\ngreasy veal and peppers splattered all over  the kitchen walls an d his finicky neatness \\nwas outraged. “You filthy guinea spoiled brat,” he said venomously. “Clean that up right \\nnow or I’ll kick the shit out of you.” \\n“Like hell I will,” Connie said. She held her hands like claws ready to scratch his bare \\nchest to ribbons. \\nCarlo went back into the bedroom and when he came ou t he was holding his belt \\ndoubled in his hand. “Clean it up,” he said and there was no mistaking the menace in his \\nvoice. She stood there not moving and he swung the belt against her heavily padded \\nhips, the leather stinging but not  really hurting. Connie retr eated to the kitchen cabinets \\nand her hand went into one of the drawers to haul out the long bread knife. She held it \\nready. \\nCarlo laughed. “Even the female Corleones ar e murderers,” he said . He put the belt \\ndown on the kitchen table and advanced towa rd her. She tried a sudden lunge but her \\npregnant heavy body made her slow and he eluded th e thrust she aimed at his groin in \\nsuch deadly earnest. He disarmed her easily and then he started to slap her face with a \\nslow medium-heavy stroke so as not to br eak the skin. He hit her again and again as \\nshe retreated around the kitchen table trying to escape him and he pursued her into the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 223\\nbedroom. She tried to bite his hand and he grabbed her by the hair to lift her head up. \\nHe slapped her face until she b egan to weep like a little girl , with pain and humiliation. \\nThen he threw her contemptuously  onto the bed. He drank fr om the bottle of whiskey \\nstill on the night table. He seemed very dr unk now, his light blue eyes had a crazy glint \\nin them and finally Connie was truly afraid. \\nCarlo straddled his legs apart and drank from  the bottle. He reached down and grabbed \\na chunk of her pregnant heavy thigh in his hand. He squeezed very hard, hurting her \\nand making her beg for mercy. “You’re fat as a pig,” he said with disgust and walked out \\nof the bedroom. \\nThoroughly frightened and cowe d, she lay in the bed, not daring to see what her \\nhusband was doing in the other room. Finally she rose and went  to the door to peer into \\nthe living room. Carlo had opened a fresh bottl e of whiskey and was sprawled on the \\nsofa. In a little while he would drink himsel f into sodden sleep and she could sneak into \\nthe kitchen and call her fam ily in Long Beach. She woul d tell her mother to send \\nsomeone out here to get her. She just hoped Sonny didn’t answer the phone, she knew \\nit would be best to talk to  Tom Hagen or her mother. \\nIt was nearly ten o’clock at night when t he kitchen phone in Don Corleone’s house rang. \\nIt was answered by one of the Don’s bodyguar ds who dutifully turned the phone over to \\nConnie’s mother. But Mrs. Corleone could hardly understand what  her daughter was \\nsaying, the girl was hysterical  yet trying to whisper so that  her husband in the next room \\nwould not hear her. Also her face had become swollen bec ause of the slaps, and her \\npuffy lips thickened her speech. Mrs. Corleone made a sign to the bodyguard that he \\nshould call Sonny, who was in the living room with Tom Hagen. \\nSonny came into the kitchen and took the phone  from his mother. “Yeah, Connie,” he \\nsaid. \\nConnie was so frightened both of her husband and of what her brother would do that her \\nspeech became worse. She babbled, “Sonny, just  send a car to bring me home, I’ll tell \\nyou then, it’s nothing, Sonny. Don’t you come . Send Tom, please, Sonny. It’s nothing, I \\njust want to come home.” \\nBy this time Hagen had come into the room. The Don was al ready under a sedated \\nsleep in the bedroom above and H agen wanted to keep an eye on Sonny in all crises. \\nThe two interior bodyguards were also in  the kitchen. Everybody  was watching Sonny \\nas he listened on the phone.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 224\\nThere was no question that th e violence in Sonny Corleone’s  nature rose from some \\ndeep mysterious physical well. As they watched they could actually see the blood \\nrushing to his heavily corded neck, could see the eyes film with hatred, the separate \\nfeatures of his face tightening, growing pinched, then his face  took on the grayish hue of \\na sick man fighting off some sort of death, except that the adrenaline pumping through \\nhis body made his hands tremble.  But his voice was controll ed, pitched low, as he told \\nhis sister, “You wait there. You ju st wait there.” He hung up the phone. \\nHe stood there for a moment quite stunned with his own rage, then he said, “The fucking \\nsonofabitch, the fucking sonofabitch.” He ran out of the house. \\nHagen knew the look on Sonny’s face, all reas oning power had left him. At this moment \\nSonny was capable of anything. Hagen also knew that the ride into the city would cool Sonny off, make him more rational. But that rationality might make him even more \\ndangerous, though the rationality would enable him to protect himself against the consequences of his rage. Hagen heard the car motor roaring into life and he said to the \\ntwo bodyguards, “Go after him.” \\nThen he went to the phone and made some calls . He arranged for some men of Sonny’s \\nregime living in the city to go up to Carlo Rizzi’s apartment and get Carlo out of there. \\nOther men would stay with Connie until Sonny arrived.  He was taking a chance, \\nthwarting Sonny, but he knew the Don would back him up. He was afraid that Sonny \\nmight kill Carlo in front of witnesses. He di d not expect trouble from the enemy. The Five \\nFamilies had been quiet too long and obviously  were looking for peace of some kind. \\nBy the time Sonny roared out of the mall in  his Buick, he had already regained, partly, \\nhis senses. He noted the two bodyguards ge tting into a car to follow him and approved. \\nHe expected no danger, the Five Families had quit counterattacking, were not really \\nfighting anymore. He had grabbe d his jacket in the foyer and there was a gun in a secret \\ndashboard compartment of the car, the car registered in the name of  a member of his \\nregime, so that he personally could not ge t into any legal trouble. But he did not \\nanticipate needing any w eapon. He did not even know what he was going to do with \\nCarlo Rizzi. \\nNow that he had a chance to thin k, Sonny knew he could not kill the father of an unborn \\nchild, and that father his sist er’s husband. Not over a domesti c spat. Except that it was \\nnot just a domestic spat. Carlo was a bad guy and Sonny felt responsible that his sister had met the bastard through him.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 225\\nThe paradox in Sonny’s violent nature was t hat he could not hit a woman and had never \\ndone so. That he could not harm a child or anything helpless. When Carlo had refused \\nto fight back against him that day, it had k ept Sonny from kill ing him; complete \\nsubmission disarmed his violence. As a bo y, he had been truly t enderhearted. That he \\nhad become a murderer as a man was simply his destiny. \\nBut he would settle this thing once and for a ll, Sonny thought, as he headed the Buick \\ntoward the causeway that would take hi m over the water from Long Beach to the \\nparkways on the other side of Jones Beach. He  always used this route when he went to \\nNew York. There was less traffic. \\nHe decided he would send Connie home with the bodyguards and t hen he would have a \\nsession with his brotherin-law. What woul d happen after that he didn’t know. If the \\nbastard had really hurt Conni e, he’d make a cri pple out of the bastard. But the wind \\ncoming over the causeway, the salty freshness of the air, cooled his anger. He put the \\nwindow down all the way. \\nHe had taken the Jones Beach Causeway, as  always, because it was usually deserted \\nthis time of night, at this time of y ear, and he could speed recklessly until he hit the \\nparkways on the other side. And even there tr affic would be light. The release of driving \\nvery fast would help dissipate what he knew  was a dangerous tension. He had already \\nleft his bodyguards car far behind. \\nThe causeway was badly lit, there was not a single car. Far ah ead he saw the white \\ncone of the manned tollbooth. \\nThere were other tollbooths bes ide it but they were sta ffed only during the day, for \\nheavier traffic. Sonny started braking the Buick and at the same time searched his \\npockets for change. He had none. He reac hed for his wallet, flipped it open with one \\nhand and fingered out a bill. He came within the arca de of light and he saw to his mild \\nsurprise a car in the tollbooth slot blocking it, the driver obviously asking some sort of \\ndirections from the toll taker. Sonny honk ed his horn and the other car obediently rolled \\nthrough to let his car slide into the slot. \\nSonny handed the toll taker the dollar bill and waited for his change. He was in a hurry \\nnow to close the window. The Atlantic Ocean ai r had chilled the whole car. But the toll \\ntaker was fumbling with his change; the dumb son of a bitch actua lly dropped it. Head \\nand body disappeared as the toll man stooped down in his booth to pick up the money. \\nAt that moment Sonny noticed  that the other car had not kept going but had parked a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 226\\nfew feet ahead, still blo cking his way. At that same moment his lateral vision caught \\nsight of another man in the da rkened tollbooth to his right. Bu t he did not have time to \\nthink about that because two men came out of the car parked in front and walked toward \\nhim. The toll collector still had not appeared. A nd then in the fraction of a second before \\nanything actually happened, Santino Corle one knew he was a dead man. And in that \\nmoment his mind was lucid, drained of all violence, as if the hidden fear finally real and \\npresent had purified him. \\nEven so, his huge body in a reflex for life crashed against the Buick door, bursting its \\nlock. The man in the darkened tollboot h opened fire and the shots caught Sonny \\nCorleone in the head and neck as his massive fr ame spilled out of the car. The two men \\nin front held up their guns now, the man in the darkened tollbooth cut his fire, and \\nSonny’s body sprawled on the asphalt with the l egs still partly inside. The two men each \\nfired shots into Sonny’s body, then kicked him in  the face to disfigure his features even \\nmore, to show a mark made by  a more personal human power. \\nSeconds afterward, all four m en, the three actual assassins and the bogus toll collector, \\nwere in their car and speeding toward the Meadowbrook Parkway on the other side of \\nJones Beach. Their pursuit was blocked by Sonny’s car and body in the tollgate slot but \\nwhen Sonny’s bodyguards pulled up a few minut es later and saw his body lying there, \\nthey had no intention to purs ue. They swung their car ar ound in a huge arc and returned \\nto Long Beach. At the first public phone off t he causeway one of them hopped out and \\ncalled Tom Hagen. He was very curt and very brisk. “Sonny’s dead, they got him at the \\nJones Beach toll.” \\nHagen’s voice was perfectly calm. “OK,” he said. “Go to Clemenza’s house and tell him \\nto come here right away. He’ll tell you what to do.” \\nHagen had taken the call in the kitchen, wit h Mama Corleone bustling around preparing \\na snack for the arrival of her daughter. He  had kept his compos ure and the old woman \\nhad not noticed anything am iss. Not that she could not have, if she wanted to, but in her \\nlife with the Don she had learn ed it was far wiser not to perceive. That if it was \\nnecessary to know something painful, it w ould be told to her soon enough. And if it was \\na pain that could be spared her, she could do without. She was quite content not to \\nshare the pain of her men, after all did th ey share the pain of women? Impassively she \\nboiled her coffee and set the table with food. In her experience pain and fear did not dull \\nphysical hunger; in her experience the taki ng of food dulled pain.  She would have been \\noutraged if a doctor had tried to sedate her wit h a drug, but coffee and a crust of bread  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 227\\nwere another matter; she came, of course, from a more pr imitive culture. \\nAnd so she let Tom Hagen escape to his co rner conference room and once in that \\nroom, Hagen began to tremble so violently he had to sit down with his legs squeezed \\ntogether, his head hunched into  his contracted shoulders,  hands clasped together \\nbetween his knees as if he were praying to the devil. \\nHe was, he knew now, no fit Consigliere for a Family at wa r. He had been fooled, faked \\nout, by the Five Families and their seeming timidity. They  had remained quiet, laying \\ntheir terrible ambush. They had planned and waited, holding their bloody hands no \\nmatter what provocation they had been given. They had waited to land one terrible blow. \\nAnd they had. Old Genco Abbandando would never have fallen for it, he would have \\nsmelled a rat, he would have smoked them out, tripled his precautions. And through all \\nthis Hagen felt his grief. Sonny had been his true br other, his savior; his hero when they \\nhad been boys together. Sonny had never been mean  or bullying with him, had always \\ntreated him with affection, had taken him in  his arms when Soll ozzo had turned him \\nloose. Sonny’s joy at that reunion had been  real. That he had grown up to be a cruel \\nand violent and bloody man was,  for Hagen, not relevant. \\nHe had walked out of the kitchen because he knew he could never tell Mama Corleone \\nabout her son’s death. He  had never thought of her as his mother as he thought of the \\nDon as his father and Sonny as his brother. His  affection for her was like his affection for \\nFreddie and Michael and Connie.  The affection for someone who has been kind but not \\nloving. But he could not tell her. In a few short months she had lost all her sons; Freddie \\nexiled to Nevada, Michael hiding for his life in Sicily, and now Sa ntino dead. Which of \\nthe three had she loved most of  all? She had never shown. \\nIt was no more than a few minutes. Hagen got  control of himself again and picked up \\nthe phone. He called Connie’s number. It rang for a long time before Connie answered \\nin a whisper. \\nHagen spoke to her gentiy. “Connie, this is  Tom. Wake your husband up, I have to talk \\nto him.” \\nConnie said in a low frightened voice, “Tom, is Sonny coming here?” \\n“No,” Hagen said. “Sonny’s not coming there. Don’t worry about that. Just wake Carlo up and tell him it’s very important I speak to him.” \\nConnie’s voice was weepy. “Tom, he beat me up, I’m afraid he’ll hurt me again if he \\nknows I called home.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 228\\nHagen said gently, “He won’t. He’ll talk to me  and I’ll straighten hi m out. Everything will \\nbe OK. Tell him it’s very important, very, very important he come  to the phone. OK?” \\nIt was almost five minutes before Carlo’s voice came over the phone, a voice half \\nslurred by whiskey and sleep. Hagen spoke sharply to make him alert. \\n“Listen, Carlo,” he said, “I’m going to te ll you something very shocking. Now prepare \\nyourself because when I tell it to you I want you to answer me ve ry casually as if it’s less \\nthan it is. I told Connie it wa s important so you have to gi ve her a story. Tell her the \\nFamily has decided to move you both to one of the houses in the mall and to give you a \\nbig job. That the Don has finally decided to  give you a chance in the hope of making \\nyour home life better. You got that?” \\nThere was a hopeful note in Carlo’s voice as he answered, “Yeah, OK.” \\nHagen went on, “In a few minutes a couple of  my men are going to knock on your door \\nto take you away with them. Tell them I want them to call me first. Just tell them that. \\nDon’t say anything else. I’ll instruct them  to leave you there with Connie. OK?” \\n“Yeah, yeah, I got it,” Carlo said. His voice was excited. The tension in Hagen’s voice \\nseemed to have finally alerted him that the news coming up was going to be really \\nimportant. \\nHagen gave it to him straight. “They killed  Sonny tonight. Don’t say anything. Connie \\ncalled him while you were asle ep and he was on his way over there, but I don’t want her \\nto know that, even if she guesses it, I don’t want her to know it for sure. She’ll start \\nthinking it’s all her fault. Now I want you to stay with her tonight an d not tell her anything. \\nI want you to make up with her. I want you to be the perfect loving husband. And I want \\nyou to stay that way until she has her baby at least. Tomorrow morning somebody, \\nmaybe you, maybe the Don, maybe her mo ther, will tell Connie t hat her brother got \\nkilled. And I want you by her side. Do me this favor and I’ll ta ke care of you in the times \\nto come. You got that?” \\nCarlo’s voice was a little shaky. “Sure, Tom,  sure. Listen, me and you always got along. \\nI’m grateful. Understand?” \\n“Yeah,” Hagen said. “Nobody will blame your fi ght with Connie for causing this, don’t \\nworry about that. I’ll take care of that.” He paused and softly, encouragingly, “Go ahead now, take care of Connie.” He broke the connection. \\nHe had learned never to make a threat, t he Don had taught him that, but Carlo had  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 229\\ngotten the message all right: he wa s a hair away from death. \\nHagen made another call to Tessio, telling him to come  to the mall in Long Beach \\nimmediately. He didn’t say why and Tessio did not ask. Hagen sighed. Now would come \\nthe part he dreaded. \\nHe would have to waken the Don from his drugged slumber. He would have to tell the \\nman he most loved in the world that he had fa iled him, that he had failed to guard his \\ndomain and the life of hi s eldest son. He would have to tell the Don everything was lost \\nunless the sick man himself c ould enter the battle. For Hagen did not delude himself. \\nOnly the great Don himself could snatch ev en a stalemate from this terrible defeat. \\nHagen didn’t even bother checking with Don Corleone’s doctors, it would be to no \\npurpose. No matter what the doctors ordered, even if they told him that the Don could \\nnot rise from his sickbed on pain of death,  he must tell his adoptive father and then \\nfollow him. And of course there was no que stion about what the Don would do. The \\nopinions of medical men were irrelevant no w, everything was irrelevant now. The Don \\nmust be told and he must either take command or order Hagen to surrender the \\nCorleone power to the Five Families. \\nAnd yet with all his heart, H agen dreaded the next hour. He tried to prepare his own \\nmanner. He would have to be in all ways strict with his own guilt. To reproach himself \\nwould only add to the Don’s burden. To show his own grief would only sharpen the grief \\nof the Don. To point out his own shortcom ings as a wartime C onsigliere, would only \\nmake the Don reproach himself for his own bad judgment for picking such a man for \\nsuch an important post. \\nHe must, Hagen knew, tell the news, present  his analysis of what must be done to \\nrectify the situation a nd then keep silent. His reactions thereafter must be the reactions \\ninvited by his Don. If the Don wanted him to show guilt, he would show guilt; if the Don \\ninvited grief, he would lay bare his genuine sorrow. \\nHagen lifted his head at the sound of motors , cars rolling up onto the mall. The \\ncaporegimes were arriving. He would brief them first and then he would go up and wake Don Corleone. He got up and went to the liquor  cabinet by the desk and took out a glass \\nand bottle. He stood there for a moment so  unnerved he could not pour the liquid from \\nbottle to glass. Behind him, he heard the door to the room close softly and, turning, he \\nsaw, fully dressed for the first ti me since he had been shot, Don Corleone. \\nThe Don walked across the room to his huge l eather armchair and sat down. He walked  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 230\\na little stiffly, his clothes hung a little loosely on his frame but to Hagen’s eyes he looked \\nthe same as always. It was almost as if by his will alone the Don had discarded all \\nexternal evidence of his still weakened frame. His fact was sternly set with all its old \\nforce and strength. He sat straight in the armchair and he said to Hagen, “Give me a \\ndrop of anisette.” \\nHagen switched bottles and poured them both a portion of the fiery, licorice-tasting \\nalcohol. It was peasant, homemade st uff, much stronger than that sold in stores, the gift \\nof an old friend who every year pres ented the Don with a small truckload. \\n“My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, ” Don Corleone said. “Outside my window I \\nsaw my caporegimes coming to the house and it is midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I \\nthink you should tell your Don what everyone knows.” \\nHagen said quietly, “I didn’t  tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you \\nand tell you the news myself. In another mom ent I would have come to waken you.” \\nDon Corleone said impassively, “But you needed a drink first.” \\n“Yes,” Hagen said. \\n“You’ve had your drink,” the Do n said. “You can tell me now.”  There was just the faintest \\nhint of reproach for Hagen’s weakness. \\n“They shot Sonny on the causeway,” Hagen said. “He’s dead.” \\nDon Corleone blinked. For just  the fraction of a second the wall of his will disintegrated \\nand the draining of his physical strength was plain on his face. Then he recovered. \\nHe clasped his hands in front of him on top of  the desk and looked directly into Hagen’s \\neyes. “Tell me everything that happened,” he said. He held up one of his hands. “No, \\nwait until Clemenza and Tessio arrive so  you won’t have to tell it all again.” \\nIt was only a few moments later that the two caporegimes were escorted into the room \\nby a bodyguard. They saw at once that t he Don knew about his son’s death because the \\nDon stood up to receive them. They embraced him as old comrades were permitted to do. They all had a drink of anisette whic h Hagen poured them before he told them the \\nstory of that night. \\nDon Corleone asked only one question at the end. “Is it certain my son is dead?” \\nClemenza answered. “Yes,” he said. “The body guards were of Santino’s regime but \\npicked by me. I questioned them when they ca me to my house. They saw his body in  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 231\\nthe light of the tollhou se. He could not live with the wounds they saw. They place their \\nlives in forfeit for what they say.” \\nDon Corleone accepted this final verdict wit hout any sign of emoti on except for a few \\nmoments of silence. Then he said, “None of you are to concern yourselves with this \\naffair. None of you are to commit any acts  of vengeance, none of you are to make any \\ninquiries to track down the murderers of my son without my express command. There \\nwill be no further acts of wa r against the Five Families without my expre ss and personal \\nwish. Our Family will cease all business operations and cease to protect any of our \\nbusiness operations until after my son’s funeral. Then we will meet here again and \\ndecide what must be done. Tonight we must do what we can for Santino, we must bury \\nhim as a Christian. I will have friends of mine arrange things with the police and all other \\nproper authorities. Clemenza, you will remain with me at all times as my bodyguard, you \\nand the men of your regime. Tessio, you will guard all other  members of my Family. \\nTom, I want you to call Am erigo Bonasera and tell him I wil l need his services at some \\ntime during this night. To wait for me at his establishment. It may be an hour, two hours, \\nthree hours. Do you all understand that?” \\nThe three men nodded. Don Corleone said, “Clemenza, get some men and cars and \\nwait for me. I will be ready in a few minutes. Tom, you did well. In the morning I want \\nConstanzia with her mother. Make arrangements for her and her husband to live in the \\nmall. Have Sandra’s friends, t he women, go to her house to stay with her. My wife will \\ngo there also when I have spoken with her. My  wife will tell her t he misfortune and the \\nwomen will arrange for the church to sa y their masses and prayers for his soul.” \\nThe Don got up from his leather armchair. The other men rose with him and Clemenza \\nand Tessio embraced him again. Hagen held the door open for the Don, who paused to look at him for a moment. Then the Don pu t his hand on Hagen’s cheek, embraced him \\nquickly, and said, in Italian,  “You’ve been a good son. You co mfort me.” Telling Hagen \\nthat he had acted properly in this terrible time. The Don went up to his bedroom to \\nspeak to his wife. It was then that Hagen made the call to Ameri go Bonasera for the \\nundertaker to redeem the favor he owed to the Corleones. \\nBook Five  \\n \\n  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 232\\nChapter 20 \\nThe death of Santino Corleon e sent shock waves through t he underworld of the nation. \\nAnd when it became known th at Don Corleone had risen from his sick bed to take \\ncharge of the Family affairs, when spies at the funeral repor ted that the Don seemed to \\nbe fully recovered, the heads of the Five Families made frantic efforts to prepare a \\ndefense against the bloody retaliatory war that was sure to follow. Nobody made the \\nmistake of assuming that Don Corleone c ould be held cheaply because of his past \\nmisfortunes. He was a man who had made only a few mistakes in his career and had \\nlearned from every one of them. \\nOnly Hagen guessed the Don’s real intentio ns and was not surprised when emissaries \\nwere sent to the Five Families to propose a peace. Not only to propose a peace but a meeting of all the Families in the city and with invitations to Families  all over the United \\nStates to attend. Since the New York Families were the most powerful in the country, it \\nwas understood that their welfare affected th e welfare of the country as a whole. \\nAt first there were suspicions. Was Don Corleone preparing a tr ap? Was he trying to \\nthrow his enemies off their guard? Was he a ttempting to prepare a wholesale massacre \\nto avenge his son? But Don Corleone soon made it  clear that he was sincere. Not only \\ndid he involve all the Families  in the country in this meet ing, but made no move to put \\nhis own people on a war footing or to enlist a llies. And then he took the final irrevocable \\nstep that established the authenticity of thes e intentions and assured the safety of the \\ngrand council to be assembled. He called on the services of the Bocchicchio Family. \\nThe Bocchicchio Family was unique in that, once a particularly ferocious branch of the \\nMafia in Sicily, it had become an instrument of peace in Am erica. Once a group of men \\nwho earned their living by a sa vage determination, they now ea rned their living in what \\nperhaps could be called a saintly fashion. T he Bocchicchios’ one asset was a closely \\nknit structure of blood relationships, a family loyalty severe even for a society where \\nfamily loyalty came before loyalty to a wife. \\nThe Bocchicchio Family, extending out to third cousins, had once numbered nearly two hundred when they ruled the part icular economy of a small se ction of southern Sicily. \\nThe income for the entire family then came from four or five flour mills, by no means owned communally, but assuring labor and br ead and a minimal security for all Family \\nmembers. This was enough, with intermarri ages, for them to present a common front \\nagainst their enemies.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 233\\nNo competing mill, no dam that  would create a water supply to  their competitors or ruin \\ntheir own selling of water, wa s allowed to be built in their corner of Sicily. A powerful \\nlandowning baron once tried to erect his own mill strictly for his personal use. The mill \\nwas burned down. He called on the carabineri  and higher authorities, who arrested three \\nof the Bocchicchio Family. Even before t he trial the manor hous e of the baron was \\ntorched. The indictment and accusations were  withdrawn. A few months later one of the \\nhighest functionaries in the Italian government arrived in Sic ily and tried to solve the \\nchronic water shortage of that island by proposing a huge dam. E ngineers arrived from \\nRome to do surveys while watched by grim natives, members of the Bocchicchio clan. \\nPolice flooded the area, housed in a specially built barracks. \\nIt looked like nothing could stop the dam from being built  and supplies and equipment \\nhad actually been unloaded in Palermo. That was as far as they got. The Bocchicchios \\nhad contacted fellow Mafia chiefs and extrac ted agreements for their aid. The heavy \\nequipment was sabotaged, the lighter equipment stolen.  Mafia deputies in the Italian \\nParliament launched a bureaucra tic counterattack against the pl anners. This went on for \\nseveral years and in that time Mussolini came  to power. The dictator decreed that the \\ndam must be built. It was not. T he dictator had known that the Mafia would be a threat to \\nhis regime, forming what amounted to a separat e authority from his own. He gave full \\npowers to a high police official, who promptly solved the pr oblem by throwing everybody \\ninto jail or deporting them to penal work is lands. In a few short years he had broken the \\npower of the Mafia, simply by arbitrarily arresting anyone even suspected of being a \\nmafioso. And so also brought ruin to a great many innocent families. \\nThe Bocchicchios had been rash enough to resort  to force against this unlimited power. \\nHalf of the men were killed in armed com bat, the other half deported to penal island \\ncolonies. There were only a handful left when arrangements were made for them to \\nemigrate to America via the clandestine under ground route of jumping ship through \\nCanada. There were almost twenty immigrants and they settled in a small town not far \\nfrom New York City, in the Hudson Valley, where by starti ng at the very bottom they \\nworked their way up to owning a garbag e hauling firm and their own trucks. They \\nbecame prosperous because they had no com petition. They had no competition \\nbecause competitors found their trucks burned and sabotaged. One persistent fellow \\nwho undercut prices was found  buried in the gar bage he had picked up  during the day, \\nsmothered to death. \\nBut as the men married, to Sicilian girl s, needless to say, children came, and the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 234\\ngarbage business though providing a living, was not really enough to pay for the finer \\nthings America had to offer. And so, as a diversification, the Bocchicchio Family became \\nnegotiators and hostages in the peace efforts of warring Mafia families. \\nA strain of stupidity ran th rough the Bocchicchio clan, or  perhaps they were just \\nprimitive. In any case they recognized thei r limitations and knew t hey could not compete \\nwith other Mafia families in the struggle to  organize and control more sophisticated \\nbusiness structures like prostitution, gamb ling, dope and public fraud. They were \\nstraight-from-the-shoulder people who could offer a gift to an ordinary patrolman but did \\nnot know how to approach a po litical bagman. They had only two assets. Their honor \\nand their ferocity. \\nA Bocchicchio never lied, nev er committed an act of treac hery. Such behavior was too \\ncomplicated. Also, a Bocchicchio never fo rgot an injury and never left it unavenged no \\nmatter what the cost. And so by accident t hey stumbled into what would prove to be \\ntheir most lucrative profession. \\nWhen warring families wanted to make peace and arrange a parley, the Bocchicchio \\nclan was contacted. The h ead of the clan would handle the initial negotiations and \\narrange for the necessary hostages. For instance, when Michael had gone to meet \\nSollozzo, a Bocchicchio had bee n left with the Corleone Family  as surety for Michael’s \\nsafety, the service paid for by Sollozzo. If Michael were killed by Sollozzo, then the \\nBocchicchio male hostage held by the Co rleone Family would be killed by the \\nCorleones. In this case the Bocchicchios would take their vengeance on Sollozzo as the \\nsource of their clansman’s death. Since the Bo cchicchios were so primitive, they never \\nlet anything, any kind of pun ishment, stand in their way of vengeance. They would give \\nup their own lives and there was no protection against them if they were betrayed. A \\nBocchicchio hostage was gilt-edged insurance. \\nAnd so now when Don Corleone employed the Bocchicchios as negotiators and \\narranged for them to supply hostages for all t he Families to come to the peace meeting, \\nthere could be no question as to his sincer ity. There could be no question of treachery. \\nThe meeting would be safe as wedding. \\nHostages given, the meeting to ok place in the director’s conference room of a small \\ncommercial bank whose president was indebted to Don Corleone and indeed some of \\nwhose stock belonged to Do n Corleone though it was in the president’s name. The \\npresident always treasured that  moment when he had offer ed to give Don Corleone a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 235\\nwritten document proving his ow nership of the shares, to preclude any treachery. Don \\nCorleone had been horrified. “I would trust you with my w hole fortune,” he told the \\npresident. “I would trust you with my life  and the welfare of my children. It is \\ninconceivable to me that you would ever trick me or otherwise betray me. My whole \\nworld, all my faith in my judgment of human character woul d collapse. Of course I have \\nmy own written records so that if somethi ng should happen to me my heirs would know \\nthat you hold something in trust for them. But I know that even if I were not here in this \\nworld to guard the interests of my childr en, you would be faithful to their needs.” \\nThe president of the bank, though not Sicilian, was a man of tender sensibilities. He \\nunderstood the Don perfectly. Now the G odfather’s request was the president’s \\ncommand and so on a Saturday afternoon, the ex ecutive suite of the bank, the inference \\nroom with its deep leather chairs, its absol ute privacy, was m ade available to the \\nFamilies. \\nSecurity at the bank was taken over by a small army of handpick ed men wearing bank \\nguard uniforms. At ten o’clock on  a Saturday morning the conference room began to fill \\nup. Besides the Five Families  of New York, there were r epresentatives from ten other \\nFamilies across the country, wit h the exception of Chicago, that black sheep of their \\nworld. They had given up trying to civilize Ch icago, and they saw no point in including \\nthose mad dogs in this important conference. \\nA bar had been set up and a small buffet. Each  representative to the conference had \\nbeen allowed one aide. Most of the Dons had br ought their Consiglieres as aides so \\nthere were comparatively few young men in the room. Tom Hagen was one of those \\nyoung men and the only one who was not Sicilian. He was an object of curiosity, a freak. \\nHagen knew his manners. He did not speak, he did not sm ile. He waited on his boss, \\nDon Corleone, with all the res pect of a favorite earl waitin g on his king; bringing him a \\ncold drink, lighting his cigar, positi oning his ashtray; wit h respect but no \\nobsequiousness. \\nHagen was the only one in that room who knew the identity of the portraits hanging on \\nthe dark paneled walls. They were mostly portra its of fabulous financial figures done in \\nrich oils. One was of Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. Hagen could not help thinking \\nthat Hamilton might have approved of th is peace meeting being held in a banking \\ninstitution. Nothing was more calming, more conducive to pure reason, than the \\natmosphere of money.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 236\\nThe arrival time had been staggered for betw een nine-thirty to ten A.M. Don Corleone, \\nin a sense the host since he ha d initiated the peace talks, had been the first to arrive; \\none of his many virtues was pun ctuality. The next to arrive was Carlo Tramonti, who had \\nmade the southern part of t he United States his territory. He was an impressively \\nhandsome middle-aged man, tall for a Sicili an, with a very deep sunburn, exquisitely \\ntailored and barbered. He did no t look Italian, he looked more like one of those pictures \\nin the magazines of millionaire fishermen lolling on their yachts. The Tramonti Family \\nearned its livelihood fr om gambling, and no one meeting their Don would ever guess \\nwith what ferocity he had won his empire. \\nEmigrating from Sicily as a small boy, he had settled in Florida and grown to manhood \\nthere, employed by the American syndicate  of Southern small-town politicians who \\ncontrolled gambling. These were very to ugh men backed up by very tough police \\nofficials and they never suspec ted that they could be over thrown by such a greenhorn \\nimmigrant. They were unprepared for his feroci ty and could not match it simply because \\nthe rewards being fought over were not, to  their minds, worth so much bloodshed. \\nTramonti won over the police with bigger shares of the gross; he exterminated those \\nredneck hooligans who ran thei r operation with such a comple te lack of imagination. It \\nwas Tramonti who opened ties with Cuba and the Bati sta regime and eventually poured \\nmoney into the pleasure resorts of Ha vana gambling houses, whorehouses, to lure \\ngamblers from the American mainland. Tramonti was now a millionaire many times over and owned one of the most luxuri ous hotels in Miami Beach. \\nWhen he came into the conference room followed by his aide,  an equally sunburned \\nConsigliere, Tramonti embraced Don Corleone, made a face  of sympathy to show he \\nsorrowed for the dead son. \\nOther Dons were arriving. They all knew each  other, they had met over the years, either \\nsocially or when in the pursuit of their businesses. They had al ways showed each other \\nprofessional courtesies and in their younger, leaner da ys had done each other little \\nservices. The second Don to arrive was Joseph Zaluchi from Detroit. The Zaluchi Family, under appropriate disg uises and covers, owned one of the horse-racing tracks in \\nthe Detroit area. They also owned a g ood part of the gambling. Zaluchi was a \\nmoon-faced, amiable-looki ng man who lived in a one-h undred-thousand-dollar house in \\nthe fashionable Grosse Pointe section of Detroit. One of his so ns had married into an \\nold, well-known American family. Zaluchi, like Don Corleone, was sophisticated. Detroit had the lowest incidence of physical violence of any of the cities controlled by the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 237\\nFamilies; there had been only two execution in the last three years in that city. He \\ndisapproved of traffic in drugs. \\nZaluchi had brought his Consigliere with him and both men came to Don Corleone to \\nembrace him. Zaluchi had a boo ming American voice with only the slightest trace of an \\nscent. He was conservatively dressed, ve ry businessman, and with a hearty goodwill to \\nmatch. He said to Don Corleone, “Only your voice could have brought me here.” Don \\nCorleone bowed his head in thanks. He could count on Zaluchi for support. \\nThe next two Dons to arrive were from the West Coast, motoring from  there in the same \\ncar since they worked together closely in any case. They were Frank Falcone and Anthony Molinari and both were younger than any of the other men who would come to \\nthe meeting; in their early fo rties. They were dressed a little more informally than the \\nothers, there was a touch of Ho llywood in their style and they  were a little more friendly \\nthan necessary. Frank Falcone controlled t he movie unions and t he gambling at the \\nstudios plus a complex of pipeline prostitution that supplie d girls to the whorehouses of \\nthe states in the Far West. It was not in th e realm of possibility for any Don to become \\n“show biz” but Falcone had just a touch. His fellow Dons distrusted him accordingly. \\nAnthony Molinari controlled the waterfronts of San Francisco  and was preeminent in the \\nempire of sports gambling. He came of It alian fishermen stock and owned the best San \\nFrancisco sea food restaurant, in which he took such pride that the legend had it he lost \\nmoney on the enterpris e by giving too good value for the prices char ged. He had the \\nimpassive face of the pr ofessional gambler and it was known that he also had \\nsomething to do with dope smuggling over the Mexican border and from the ships plying \\nthe lanes of the oriental oceans. Their aides were young, powerfully built men, obviously \\nnot counselors but bodyguards, though they would not dare to carry arms to this \\nmeeting. It was general k nowledge that these bo dyguards knew karate, a fact that \\namused the other Dons but did not alarm them in the slightest, no more than if the California Dons had come wearing amulets blessed by the Pope. Though it must be \\nnoted that some of these men were  religious and believed in God. \\nNext arrived the representative from the Fam ily in Boston. This was the only Don who \\ndid not have the respect of his fellows. He was known as a man w ho did not do right by \\nhis “people,” who cheated them unmercifu lly. This could be forgiven, each man \\nmeasures his own greed. What  could not be forgiven was t hat he could not keep order \\nin his empire. The Boston area had too many murders, too many petty wars for power, \\ntoo many unsupported free-lance activities; it flouted the law too brazenly. If the Chicago  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 238\\nMafia were savages, then the Boston people we re gavones, or uncouth louts; ruffians. \\nThe Boston Don’s name was Domenick Panza. He was shor t, squat; as one Don put it, \\nhe looked like a thief. \\nThe Cleveland syndicate, perhaps the most power ful of the strictly gambling operations \\nin the United States, was r epresented by a sensitive-look ing elderly man with gaunt \\nfeatures and scow-white hair. He  was known, of course not to his face, as “the Jew” \\nbecause he had surrounded himself with Jewish as sistants rather than Sicilians. It was \\neven rumored that he would have named a Jew as his Consigliere if he had dared. In \\nany case, as Don Corleone’s Family was known as the Irish Gang because of Hagen’s \\nmembership, so Don Vincent Forlenza’s Family was known as the Jewish Family with \\nsomewhat more accuracy. But he ran an extremely efficient  organization and he was not \\nknown ever to have fainted at the sight of bl ood, despite his sensitive features. He ruled \\nwith an iron hand in a velvet political glove. \\nThe representatives of the Five  Families of New York were the last to arrive and Tom \\nHagen was struck by how much  more imposing, impressive , these five men were than \\nthe out-of-towners, the hicks. For one thing, the five New Yo rk Dons were in the old \\nSicilian tradition, they were “men with a belly ” meaning, figuratively, power and courage; \\nand literally, physical flesh, as if the two went together, as indeed they seem to have \\ndone in Sicily. The five New York Dons were stout, corpulent men with massive leonine heads, features on a large scale, fleshy imperial noses, thick mouths, heavy folded \\ncheeks. They were not too well tailored or barbered; they had the look of no-nonsense \\nbusy men without vanity. \\nThere was Anthony Stracci, who controlled t he New Jersey area and the shipping on the \\nWest Side docks of Manhattan. He ran the gambling in Jersey  and was very strong with \\nthe Democratic political machine. He had a fl eet of freight hauling trucks that made him \\na fortune primarily because his trucks coul d travel with a heavy overload and not be \\nstopped and fined by highway weight inspecto rs. These trucks helped ruin the highways \\nand then his roadbuilding firm, with lucrative state contra cts, repaired the damage \\nwrought. It was the kind of operation that wo uld warm any man’s heart, business of itself \\ncreating more business. Stracci, too, was ol d-fashioned and never dealt in prostitution, \\nbut because his business was on the waterfront it was impossible for him not to be involved in the drug-smuggling traffic. Of the five New Yo rk Families opposing the \\nCorleones his was the least power ful but the most well disposed. \\nThe Family that controlled upper New York State, that  arranged smuggling of Italian  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 239\\nimmigrants from Canada, all upstate gambli ng and exercised veto power on state \\nlicensing of racing tracks, was headed by Ottilio Cuneo. This was a completely \\ndisarming man with the face of a jolly rou nd peasant baker, whose legitimate activity \\nwas one of the big milk companies. Cuneo  was one of those men who loved children \\nand carried a pocket full of sweets in the hopes of being able to pleasure one of his \\nmany grandchildren or the small offspring of his associates. He wore a round fedora \\nwith the brim turned down all the way r ound like a woman’s sun hat, which broadened \\nhis already moon-shaped face into the very ma sk of joviality. He was one of the few \\nDons who had never been arrested and whose true activities had never even been \\nsuspected. So much so that he had served on civic committees and had been voted as \\n“Businessman of the Year for the State of  New York” by the Chamber of Commerce. \\nThe closest ally to the Tattaglia Family wa s Don Emilio Barzini. He had some of the \\ngambling in Brooklyn and some in Queens. He had some prostitution. He had \\nstrong-arm. He completely cont rolled Staten Island. He had some  of the sports betting in \\nthe Bronx and Westchester. He was in narcotics. He had cl ose ties to Cleveland and the \\nWest Coast and he was one of the few men shrewd enough to be interested in Las \\nVegas and Reno, the open cities of Nevada. He also had in terests in Miami Beach and \\nCuba. After the Corleone Fami ly, his was perhaps the st rongest in New York and \\ntherefore in the country. His  influence reached even to Sicily. His hand was in every \\nunlawful pie. He was even rumored to have a toehold in Wall Stre et. He had supported \\nthe Tattaglia Family with money  and influence since the star t of the war. It was his \\nambition to supplant Don Corleone as the most  powerful and respected Mafia leader in \\nthe country and to take over part of the Corleone empire. He was a man much like Don \\nCorleone, but more modern, more sophisticat ed, more businesslike. He could never be \\ncalled an old Moustache Pete and he had the confidence of the newer, younger, brasher \\nleaders on their way up. He was a man of great personal force in a cold way, with none \\nof Don Corleone’s warmth and he was perhaps at  this moment the most “respected” \\nman in the group. \\nThe last to arrive was Don Phillip Tattaglia , the head of the Tatta gfia Family that had \\ndirectly challenged the Corleone power by  supporting Sollozzo, and had so nearly \\nsucceeded. And yet curiously enough he was held in a slight contem pt by the others. \\nFor one thing, it was known that he had allowed himself to be dominated by Sollozzo, \\nhad in fact been led by the nose by that fine Turkish hand. He was held responsible for \\nall this commotion, this uproar that had so affected the conduct of everyday business by  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 240\\nthe New York Families. Also he was a si xty-year-old dandy and woman-chaser. And he \\nhad ample opportunity to indulge his weakness. \\nFor the Tattaglia Family dealt in women. Its  main business was prostitution. It also \\ncontrolled most of the night clubs in the United States and could place any talent \\nanywhere in the country. Phillip Tattaglia wa s not above using strong-arm to get control \\nof promising singers and comics and muscling in  on record firms. But prostitution was \\nthe main source of the Family income. \\nHis personality was unpleasant to these men.  He was a whiner, always complaining of \\nthe costs in his Family busine ss. Laundry bills, all those towe ls, ate up the profits (but he \\nowned the laundry firm that di d the work). The girls were lazy and unstable, running off, \\ncommitting suicide. The pimps were treacher ous and dishonest and without a shred of \\nloyalty. Good help was hard to find. Young lads of Sici lian blood turned up their noses at \\nsuch work, considered it beneath their hono r to traffic and abuse women; those rascals \\nwho would slit a throat with a song on their lip s and the cross of an Easter palm in the \\nlapel of their jackets. So Phillip Tattaglia would rant on to audiences unsympathetic and \\ncontemptuous. His biggest howl was reserved for aut horities who had it in their power to \\nissue and cancel liquor licenses for his nigh tclubs and cabarets. He swore he had made \\nmore millionaires than Wall Street with t he money he had paid those thieving guardians \\nof official seals. \\nIn a curious way his almost victorious war against the Co rleone Family had not won him \\nthe respect it deserved. They knew his str ength had come first from Sollozzo and then \\nfrom the Barzini Family. Also the fact that wi th the advantage of surprise he had not won \\ncomplete victory was evidence against him. If he had been more efficient, all this trouble \\ncould have been avoided. The d eath of Don Corleone would have meant the end of the \\nwar. \\nIt was proper, since they had both lost sons in their war against each other, that Don \\nCorleone and Phillip Tattaglia should acknowledge each other’s presence only with a \\nformal nod. Don Corleone was the object of attention, the ot her men studying him to see \\nwhat mark of weakness had been left on him by his wounds and defeats. The puzzling \\nfactor was why Don Corleone ha d sued for peace after the death of his favorite son. It \\nwas an acknowledgment of defeat and would almo st surely lead to a lessening of his \\npower. But they would soon know. \\nThere were greetings, there we re drinks to be served and al most another half hour went  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 241\\nby before Don Corleone took his seat at the polished walnut table. Unobtrusively, Hagen \\nsat in the chair slightly to the Don’s left and behind him. This was the signal for the other \\nDons to make their way to the table. Thei r aides sat behind them , the Consiglieres up \\nclose so that they could offer any advice when needed. \\nDon Corleone was the first to speak and he spoke as if not hing had happened.  As if he \\nhad not been grievously wounded and his eldest son slain, his empire in a shambles, his \\npersonal family scattered, Freddi e in the West and under the protection of the Molinari \\nFamily and Michael secr eted in the wastelands of Sicily . He spoke naturally, in Sicilian \\ndialect. \\n“I want to thank you all for coming,” he sa id. “I consider it a service done to me \\npersonally and I am in the debt of each and every one of you.  And so I will say at the \\nbeginning that I am here not to quarrel or convince, but only to reason and as a \\nreasonable man do everything possible for us all to part friends here too. I give my word on that, and some of you who know me well k now I do not give my word lightly. Ah, well, \\nlet’s get down to business.. We are all honor able men here, we don’t have to give each \\nother assurances as if we were lawyers.” \\nHe paused. None of the others spoke. Some were smoking cigars, others sipping their \\ndrinks. All of these men were  good listeners, pati ent men. They had one other thing in \\ncommon. They were those rarities, men who had refused to accept the rule of organized \\nsociety, men who refused the dominion of ot her men. There was no force, no mortal \\nman who could bend them to  their will unless they wished it. They were men who \\nguarded their free will with wi les and murder. Their wills could be subverted only by \\ndeath. Or the utmo st reasonableness. \\nDon Corleone sighed. “How did things ever go so far?” he asked rhetorically. “Well, no \\nmatter. A lot of foolishness has come to pa ss. It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary. \\nBut let me tell what happened, as I see it.” \\nHe paused to see if someone would object to his telling his side of the story. \\n“Thank God my health has been restored and ma ybe I can help set this affair aright. \\nPerhaps my son was too rash, too headstrong, I don’t say no to that. Anyway let me just \\nsay that Sollozzo came to me with a business affair in which he asked me for my money \\nand my influence. He said he ha d the interest of the Tattaglia  Family. The affair involved \\ndrugs, in which I have no interest. I’m a quiet  man and such endeavors are too lively for \\nmy taste. I explained this to Sollozzo, with a ll respect for him and the Tattaglia Family. I  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 242\\ngave him my ‘no’ with all courtesy. I told hi m his business would not interfere with mine, \\nthat I had no objection to his ea rning his living in this fashi on. He took it ill and brought \\nmisfortune down on all our heads. Well, that’s life. Everyone here could tell his own tale \\nof sorrow. That’s not to my purpose.” \\nDon Corleone paused and motioned to Hagen for a cold drink, which Hagen swiftly \\nfurnished him. Don Corleone wet his mouth. “I’m willing to make the peace,” he said. \\n“Tattaglia has lost a son, I have lost a son. We are quits. What w ould the world come to \\nif people kept carrying grudges against all r eason? That has been the cross of Sicily, \\nwhere men are so busy with vendettas they hav e no time to earn bread for their families. \\nIt’s foolishness. So I say now, let things be as they were before.  I have not taken any \\nsteps to learn who betrayed and killed my s on. Given peace, I will not do so. I have a \\nson who cannot come home and I must receive assurances that when I arrange matters \\nso that he can return safely that t here will be no interference, no danger from the \\nauthorities. Once that’s settled maybe we can talk about other matters  that interest us \\nand do ourselves, all of us, a profitable service today.” Co rleone gestured expressively, \\nsubmissively, with his hands. “That is all I want.” \\nIt was very well done. It was the Don Corleo ne of old. Reasonable. Pliant. Soft-spoken. \\nBut every man there had noted that he had claimed good health, which meant he was a \\nman not to be held cheaply despi te the misfortunes of the Corleone Family. It was noted \\nthat he had said the discussion of other business was useless until the peace he asked \\nfor was given. It was noted that he had asked fo r the old status quo, that he would lose \\nnothing despite his having got the wo rst of it over the past year. \\nHowever, it was Emilio Barzini who answer ed Don Corleone, not Tattaglia. He was curt \\nand to the point without being rude or insulting. \\n“That is all true enough,” Barzini said. “But there’s a little more. Don Corleone is too \\nmodest. The fact is that Sollozzo and the Tatt aglias could not go into their new business \\nwithout the assistance of Don Corleone. In fac t, his disapproval injured them. That’s not \\nhis fault of course. The fact remains that ju dges and politicians wh o would accept favors \\nfrom Don Corleone, even on drugs, would not  allow themselves to be influenced by \\nanybody else when it came to narcotics. Soll ozzo couldn’t operate  if he didn’t have \\nsome insurance of his people being treated gently . We all know that. We would all be \\npoor men otherwise. And now that they have increased the penalties the judges and the \\nprosecuting attorneys drive a hard bargain when one of our people get in trouble with \\nnarcotics. Even a Sicilian sentenced to twenty years might break the omerta and talk his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 243\\nbrains out. That can’t happen. Don Corleone c ontrols all that apparatus. His refusal to \\nlet us use it is not the act of a friend. He takes the bread out of  the mouths of our \\nfamilies. Times have changed, it’s not like t he old days where everyone can go his own \\nway. If Corleone had all the judges in New Yo rk, then he must share them or let us \\nothers use them. Certainly he can present  a bill for such services, we’re not \\ncommunists, after all. But he has to let us dr aw water from the well. It’s that simple.” \\nWhen Barzini had finished talking there was a silence. The lines we re now drawn, there \\ncould be no return to the old status quo. W hat was more important was that Barzini by \\nspeaking out was saying that if peace was not  made he would openly join the Tattaglia \\nin their war against the Corleone. And he had scored a telling point. Their lives and their \\nfortunes depended upon their doing each other services, the denial of a favor asked by \\na friend was an act of aggression. Favors we re not asked lightly and so could not be \\nlightly refused. \\nDon Corleone finally spoke to an swer. “My friends,” he said, “I didn’t refuse out of spite. \\nYou all know me. When have I ever refused an accommodation? That’s simply not in my \\nnature. But I had to refuse this time. Why? Because I think this drug business will \\ndestroy us in the years to come. There is too much strong feeling about such traffic in \\nthis country. It’s not like whiskey or gam bling or even women wh ich most people want \\nand is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the church and the government. But \\ndrugs are dangerous for every one connected with them. It could jeopardize all other \\nbusiness. And let me say I’m fl attered by the belief that I am  so powerful with the judges \\nand law officials, I wish it were true. I do have some influence but many of the people \\nwho respect my counsel might lose this respect if drugs become involved in our relationship. They are afraid to be involved  in such business and they have strong \\nfeelings about it. Even policem en who help us in gambling and other things would refuse \\nto help us in drugs. So to ask me to perform a service in these matters is to ask me to \\ndo a disservice to myself. But I’m willing to do ev en that if all of yo u think it proper in \\norder to adjust other matters.” \\nWhen Don Corleone had finished speaking the room became much more relaxed with \\nmore whisperings and cross talk. He had c onceded the important point. He would offer \\nhis protection to any organized business ventur e in drugs. He was, in effect, agreeing \\nalmost entirely to Sollozzo’s original prop osal if that proposal  was endorsed by the \\nnational group gathered here. It was understood that he would never participate in the \\noperational phase, nor would he invest his m oney. He would merely use his protective  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 244\\ninfluence with the legal apparatus. But this was a formidable concession. \\nThe Don of Los Angeles, Fr ank Falcone, spoke to answer. “There’s no way of stopping \\nour people from going into that business..T hey go in on their own and they get is \\ntrouble. There’s too much money in it to resi st. So it’s more dangerous if we don’t go in. \\nAt least if we control it we can cover it better,  organize it better, make sure it causes less \\ntrouble. Being in it is not so bad, there has to be control,  there has to be protection, \\nthere has to be organization,  we can’t have everybody running around doing just what \\nthey please like a bunch of anarchists.” \\nThe Don of Detroit, more fr iendly to Corleone than any of the others, also now spoke \\nagainst his friend’s position, in the interest of reasonableness. “I don’ t believe in drugs,” \\nhe said. “For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn’t do that kind of business. But \\nit didn’t matter, it didn’t  help. Somebody comes to them and says, ‘I have powders, if \\nyou put up the three-, four-t housand-dollar investment we  can make fifty thousand \\ndistributing.’ Who can resist such a profit? And they are so busy with their little side \\nbusiness they neglect the work I pay them to do. There’s more money in drugs. It’s \\ngetting bigger all the time. T here’s no way to stop it so we  have to control the business \\nand keep it respectable. I don’t w ant any of it near schools, I do n’t want any of it sold to \\nchildren. That is an infamita. In  my city I would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, \\nthe colored. They are the best customers,  the least troublesome and they are animals \\nanyway. They have no respect for their wives or their families or for themselves. Let \\nthem lose their souls with drugs. But someth ing has to be done, we just can’t let people \\ndo as they please and make trouble for everyone.” \\nThis speech of the Detroit Don was received with loud murmurs of approval. He had hit \\nthe nail on the head. You couldn’t even pay people to  stay out of the drug traffic. As for \\nhis remarks about children, that was his we ll-known sensibility, his tenderheartedness \\nspeaking. After all, who wo uld sell drugs to children? Where would children get the \\nmoney? As for his remarks about the color eds, that was not even heard. The Negroes \\nwere considered of absolutely no account, of no force whatsoever. That they had \\nallowed society to grind them into t he dust proved them of no account and his \\nmentioning them in any way proved that t he Don of Detroit had a mind that always \\nwavered toward irrelevancies. \\nAll the Dons spoke. Ail of them deplored the traffic in drugs as a bad thing that would \\ncause trouble but agreed there wa s no way to control it. Ther e was, simply, too much \\nmoney to be made in the busin ess, therefore it followed that there would be men who  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 245\\nwould dare anything to dabble in it. That was human nature. \\nIt was finally agreed. Drug traffic would be permitted and Don Corl eone must give it \\nsome legal protection in the East. It was understood that the Ba rzini and Tattaglia \\nFamilies would do most of t he large-scale operations. With  this out of the way the \\nconference was able to move on to other matte rs of a wider interest. There were many \\ncomplex problems to be solved. It was agreed that Las Vegas and Miami were to be \\nopen cities where any of the Families could operate. They all recognized that these \\nwere the cities of the futu re. It was also agreed that no violence would be permitted in \\nthese cities and that petty criminals of all types were to be discouraged. It was agreed \\nthat in momentous affairs, in executions t hat were necessary but might cause too much \\nof a public outcry, the execut ion must be approved by this council. It was agreed that \\nbutton men and other soldiers we re to be restrained from violent crimes and acts of \\nvengeance against each other on personal matters. It was agreed that Families would \\ndo each other services when requested, such  as providing executioners, technical \\nassistance in pursuing certain courses of action such as bribing jurors, which in some \\ninstances could be vital. These discussions, in formal, colloquial and on a high level, took \\ntime and were broken by lunch and drinks from the buffet bar. \\nFinally Don Barzini sought to  bring the meeting to an end. “That’s the whole matter \\nthen,” he said. “We have the peace and let me pay  my respects to Don Corleone, whom \\nwe all have known over the years as a man of his word. If there are any more \\ndifferences we can meet again, we need not become foolish again. On my part the road \\nis new and fresh. I’m glad this is all settled.” \\nOnly Phillip Tattaglia was a little worried still. The mur der of Santino Corleone made him \\nthe most vulnerable person in this group if war broke out again. He  spoke at length for \\nthe first time. \\n“I’ve agreed to everything here, I’m willing to fo rget my own misfortune. But I would like \\nto hear some strict assurances from Corleone. Will he attempt any individual \\nvengeance? When time goes by and his posit ion perhaps becomes stronger, will he \\nforget that we have sworn our friendship? How am I to know that in three or four years \\nhe won’t feel that he’s been ill served, forced against his will to this agreement and so \\nfree to break it? Will we have to guard against each other all the time? Or can we truly \\ngo in peace with peace of mind? Would Corleone give us all his assurances as I now \\ngive mine?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 246\\nIt was then that Don Corleone gave the s peech that would be long remembered, and \\nthat reaffirmed his position as the most  far-seeing statesman among them, so full of \\ncommon sense, so direct from the heart; and to the heart of the matter. In it he coined a \\nphrase that was to become as famous in its way as  Churchill’s Iron Curtain, though not \\npublic knowledge until more than ten years later. \\nFor the first time he stood up to address the council. He was short and a little thin from \\nhis “illness,” perhaps his sixty years showed a bit more but there was no question that \\nhe had regained all his former st rength, and had all his wits. \\n“What manner of men ar e we then, if we do not have our  reason,” he said. “We are all \\nno better than beasts in a jungl e if that were the case. But we have reason, we can \\nreason with each other and we can reason wit h ourselves. To what purpose would I \\nstart all these troubles again, the violence and the turmoil? My son is dead and that is a \\nmisfortune and I must bear it, not make t he innocent world around me suffer with me. \\nAnd so I say, I give my honor, that I will  never seek vengeance, I will never seek \\nknowledge of the deeds that have been done in the past. I will leave here with a pure \\nheart. \\n“Let me say that we must always look to ou r interests. We are all men who have refused \\nto be fools, who have refused to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by the men on \\nhigh. We have been fortunate her e in this country. Already most of our children have \\nfound a better life. Some of you have sons w ho are professors, scientists, musicians, \\nand you are fortunate. Perhaps  your grandchildren will become the new pezzonovanti. \\nNone of us here want to see our children follow in our footsteps, it’s too hard a life. They \\ncan be as others, their posit ion and security won by our courage. I have grandchildren \\nnow and I hope their children ma y someday, who knows, be a governor, a President, \\nnothing’s impossible herein Amer ica. But we have to progress with the times. The time \\nis past for guns and killings and massacres . We have to be cxmning like the business \\npeople, there’s more money in it and it’s better for our children and our grandchildren. \\n“As for our own deeds, we are not responsible  to the.90 calibers the pezzonovantis who \\ntake it upon themselves to dec ide what we shall do with our lives, who declare wars they \\nwish us to fight in to protect what they own. Who is to say we should obey the laws they \\nmake for their own interest and to our hurt? And who are t hey then to meddle when we \\nlook after our own interests? Sonna coca nostra,” Don Corleone said, “these are our \\nown affairs. We will manage our world for oursel ves because it is our world, cosa nostra. \\nAnd so we have to stick together to guard against outside meddlers. Otherwise they will  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 247\\nput the ring in our nose as they have put t he ring in the nose of all the millions of \\nNeapolitans and other Italians in this country. \\n“For this reason I forgo my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good. I swear \\nnow that as long as I am responsible for t he actions of my Family there will not be one \\nfinger lifted against any man here without just cause and utmost provocation. I am \\nwilling to sacrifice my commercial interests for the common good. This is my word, this \\nis my honor, there are thos e of you here who know I have never betrayed either. \\n“But I have a selfish interest. My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo’s murder and that of a police capt ain. I must now make arrangement s so that he can come home \\nwith safety, cleared of all those false charges . That is my affair and I will make those \\narrangements. I must find the real culprits perhaps, or perhaps I must convince the \\nauthorities of his inno cence, perhaps the witnesses and in formants will recant their lies. \\nBut again I say that this is my affair and I believe I will be  able to bring my son home. \\n“But let me say this. I am a superstitious man, a ridiculous failing but I must confess it \\nhere. And so if some unlucky  accident should befall my younge st son, if some police \\nofficer should accidentally shoot him, if he should hang himself in his cell, if new \\nwitnesses appear to testify to his guilt, my super stition will make me f eel that it was the \\nresult of the ill will still borne me by some people here. Let me go further. If my son is \\nstruck by a bolt of lightning I will blame some of the peopl e here. If his plane show fall \\ninto the sea or his ship sink beneath the wave s of the ocean, if he should catch a mortal \\nfever, if his automobile should be struck by a train, such is my s uperstition that I would \\nblame the ill will felt by people here. Gentlem en, that ill will, that bad luck, I could never \\nforgive. But aside from that let me swear by the souls of my grandchildren that I will \\nnever break the peace we have made. After all,  are we or are we not better men than \\nthose pezzonovanti who have killed countless  millions of men in our lifetimes?” \\nWith this Don Corleone stepped from his pl ace and went down the table to where Don \\nPhillip Tattaglia was sitting. Tattaglia ro se to greet him and the two men embraced, \\nkissing each other’s cheeks. The other Dons  in the room applauded and rose to shake \\nhands with everybody in sight and to congr atulate Don Corleone  and Don Tattaglia on \\ntheir new friendship. It was not perhaps the wa rmest friendship in the world, they would \\nnot send each other Christmas gift greetings, but they would not murder each other. \\nThat was friendship enough in this world, all that was needed. \\nSince his son Freddie was under the protection of the Molinar i Family in the West, Don  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 248\\nCorleone lingered with the San Francisco Don after the meet ing to thank him. Molinari \\nsaid enough for Don Corleone to gather that Freddie had found his niche out there, was \\nhappy and had become something of a ladies’ m an. He had a genius for running a hotel, \\nit seemed. Don Corleone shook his head in wonder, as many fathers do when told of \\nundreamed-of talents in their children. Wasn ’t it true that sometimes the greatest \\nmisfortunes brought unforese en rewards? They both ag reed that this was so. \\nMeanwhile Corleone made it clea r to the San Francisco Don that he was in his debt for \\nthe great service done in protecting Freddie. He let it be k nown that his influence would \\nbe exerted so that t he important racing wires would alwa ys be available to his people no \\nmatter what changes occurred in the power stru cture in the years to come, an important \\nguarantee since the struggle over this fa cility was a constant open wound complicated \\nby the fact that the Chic ago people had their heavy hand in it. But Don Corleone was \\nnot without influence even in that land of barbarians and so  his promise was a gift of \\ngold. \\nIt was evening before Don Corleone, Tom Hagen and the bodyguar d-chauffeur, who \\nhappened to be Rocco Lampone, a rrived at the mall in Long Beach. When they went \\ninto the house the Don said to Hagen, “Our  driver, that man Lam pone, keep an eye on \\nhim. He’s a fellow worth something bette r I think.” Hagen wondered at this remark. \\nLampone had not said a word al l day, had not even glanced at  the two men in the back \\nseat. He had opened the door for the Don, the car had been in front of the bank when \\nthey emerged, he had done ev erything correctly but no more than any well-trained \\nchauffeur might do. Evidently the Don’ s eye had seen something he had not seen. \\nThe Don dismissed Hagen and told him to co me back to the house after supper. But to \\ntake his time and rest a little since they woul d put in a long night of discussion. He also \\ntold Hagen to have Clemenza and Tessio pres ent. They should come at ten P.M., not \\nbefore. Hagen was to brief Clemenza and Tessio on what had happened at the meeting \\nthat afternoon. \\nAt ten the Don was waiting for the three men in his office, the corner room of the house \\nwith its law library and spec ial phone. There was a tray with whiskey bottles, ice and \\nsoda water. The Don gave his instructions. \\n“We made the peace this afternoon,” he said. “I gave my word and my honor and that \\nshould be enough for all of you. Bu t our friends are not so trustworthy so let’s all be on \\nour guard still. We don’t want  any more nasty little surp rises.” Then Don turned to \\nHagen. “You’ve let the Bocchicchio hostages go?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 249\\nHagen nodded. “I called Clemenza as soon as I got home.” \\nCorleone turned to the massive Clemenza. T he caporegime nodded. “I released them. \\nTell me, Godfather, is it pos sible for a Sicilian to be as dumb as the Bocchicchios \\npretend to be?” \\nDon Corleone smiled a little. “They are clever  enough to make a good living. Why is it so \\nnecessary to be more clever than that? It’ s not the Bocchicchios who cause the troubles \\nof this world. But it’s true, they haven’t got the Sicilian head.” \\nThey were all in a relaxed mood, now that the war was over. Don Corleone himself \\nmixed drinks and brought one to each man. The Don sipped his carefully and lit up a \\ncigar. \\n“I want nothing set forth to discover what happened to Sonny, that’s done with and to be \\nforgotten. I want all cooperat ion with the other Families even if they become a little \\ngreedy and we don’t get our proper share in this. I want nothing to break this peace no \\nmatter what the provocation until we’ve fou nd a way to bring Michael home. And I want \\nthat to be first thing on your minds. Reme mber this, when he comes back he must come \\nback in absolute safety. I don’t mean from the Tattaglias or the Barzinis. What I’m \\nconcerned about are the po lice. Sure, we can get rid of the real evidence against him; \\nthat waiter won’t testify, nor that spectato r or gunman or whatever he was. The real \\nevidence is the least of our worries since we know about it. What we have to worry \\nabout is the police framing false evidence be cause their informers have assured them \\nthat Michael Corleone is the man who kill ed their captain. Very well. We have to \\ndemand that the Five Families do everything in their power to correct this belief of the \\npolice. All their informers who work with t he police must come up with new stories. I \\nthink after my speech this afternoon they will un derstand it is to their interest to do so. \\nBut that’s not enough. We have to come up with something special so Michael won’t \\never have to worry about that again. Otherwise there’s no poi nt in him coming back to \\nthis country. So let’s all think about t hat. That’s the most importunt matter. \\n“Now, any man should be allowed one foolishness in his life. I have had mine. I want all \\nthe land around the mall bought, the houses bought. I don’t wa nt any man able to look \\nout his window into my garden ev en if it’s a mile away. I w ant a fence around the mall \\nand I want the mall to be on full  protection all the time. I w ant a gate in that fence. In \\nshort, I wish now to live in a fortress. Let me say to you now that I will never go into the \\ncity to work again. I will be semiretired. I feel  an urge to work in the garden, to make a  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 250\\nlittle wine when the grapes are in season. I want  to live in my house. The only time I’ll \\nleave is to go on a little vaca tion or to see someone on im portant business and then I \\nwant all precautions taken. Now don’t take th is amiss. I’m not preparing anything. I’m \\nbeing prudent, I’ve always been a prudent man, there is nothing I find so little to my \\ntaste as carelessness in lif e. Women and children can afford to be careless, men \\ncannot. Be leisurely in all these things, no frantic preparations to alarm our friends. It \\ncan be done in such a way as to seem natural. \\n“Now I’m going to leave things more and more up to each of you three. I want the \\nSantino regime disbanded and the men placed in  your regimes. That should reassure \\nour friends and show that I m ean peace. Tom, I want you to  put together a group of men \\nwho will go to Las Vegas and give me a full report on what is going on out there. Tell me \\nabout Fredo, what is really ha ppening out there, I hear I woul dn’t recognize my own son. \\nIt seems he’s a cook now, that be amuses hi mself with young girl s more than a grown \\nman should. Well, he was always too serious when he was young and he was never the \\nman for Family business. But let’s find out what really can be done out there.” \\nHagen said quietly, “Should we send your son- in-law? After all, Carlo is a native of \\nNevada, he knows his way around.” \\nDon Corleone shook his head. “N o, my wife is lonely here wit hout any of her children. I \\nwant Constanzia and her hus band moved into one of the houses on the mall. I want \\nCarlo given a responsible job, maybe I’ve  been too harsh on him, and”– Don Corleone \\nmade a grimace– “I’m short of sons. Take hi m out of the gambling and put him in with \\nthe unions where he can do so me paper work and a lot of talk ing. He’s a good talker.” \\nThere was the tiniest note of c ontempt in the Don’s voice. \\nHagen nodded. “OK, Clemenza and I will go over all t he people and put together a \\ngroup to do the Vegas job. Do you want me  to call Freddie home for a few days?” \\nThe Don shook his head. He said cruelly, “W hat for? My wife can still cook our meals. \\nLet him stay out there.” The three men shifted uneasily in their seats. They had not realized Freddie was in such severe disfavor  with his father and they suspected it must \\nbe because of something they did not know. \\nDon Corleone sighed. “I hope to grow some good green peppers and tomatoes in the \\ngarden this year, more than we can eat. I’ll make you presents of them. I want a little \\npeace, a little quiet and tranquillity for my old age.  Well, that’s all. Have another drink if \\nyou like.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 251\\nIt was a dismissal. The men rose. Hagen accompanied Clemenza and Tessio to their \\ncars and arranged meetings with them to thra sh out the operational details that would \\naccomplish the stated desires of their Don.  Then he went back into the house where he \\nknew Don Conrleone world be waiting for him. \\nThe Don had taken off his jacket and tie and was lying down on the couch. His stern face was relaxed into lines of fatigue. He  waved Hagen into a chair and said, “Well, \\nConsigliere, do you disapprove of any of my deeds today?” \\nHagen took his time answering. “No,” he said. “But I don’t find it consistent, nor true to \\nyour nature. You say you don ’t want to find out how Sa ntino was killed or want \\nvengeance for it. I don’t believe that. You gav e your word for peace and so you’ll keep \\nthe peace but I can’t believe yo u will give your enemies the victory they seem to have \\nwon today. You’ve constructed a magnificent riddle that I can’t solve, so how can I \\napprove or disapprove?” \\nA look of content came over the Don’s fa ce. “Well, you know me better than anyone \\nelse. Even though you’re not a Si cilian, I made you one. Everything you say is true, but \\nthere’s a solution and you’ll comprehend it before it spins out to the end. You agree \\neveryone has to take my word and I’ll k eep my word. And I want my orders obeyed \\nexactly. But, Tom, the most im portant thing is we have to ge t Michael home as soon as \\npossible. Make that first in your mind and in your work. Ex plore all the legal alleys, I \\ndon’t care how much money you have to sp end. It has to be foolproof when he comes \\nhome. Consult the best lawyers on criminal la w. I’ll give you the names of some judges \\nwho will give you a private audience. Until that time we have to guard against all \\ntreacheries.” \\nHagen said, “Like you, I’m not worried so much about the real evidence as the evidence \\nthey will manufacture. Also some police friend may kill Michael  after he’s arrested. They \\nmay kill him in his cell or have one of the pr isoners do it. As I see it, we can’t even afford \\nto have him arrested or accused.” \\nDon Corleone sighed. “I know, I know. That’s the difficulty. But we can’t take too long. \\nThere are troubles in Sicily. The young fellows over  there don’t listen to their elders \\nanymore and a lot of the men deported from  America are just too much for the \\nold-fashioned Dons to handle. Michael coul d get caught in between. I’ve taken some \\nprecautions against that and he’s still got a good cover but that cover won’t last forever. \\nThat’s one of the reasons I had to make the peac e. Barzini has friends in Sicily and they  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 252\\nwere beginning to sniff Michael’s trail. That gives you one of the answers to your riddle. I \\nhad to make the peace to insure my son’s safety. There was nothing else to do.” \\nHagen didn’t bother asking the Don how he had gotten this information. He was not \\neven surprised, and it was true that this so lved part of the riddle. “When I meet with \\nTattaglia’s people to firm up the details, shoul d I insist that all his drug middlemen be \\nclean? The judges will be a littl e skittish about giving light sentences to a man with a \\nrecord.” \\nDon Corleone shrugged. “They should be smart enough to figu re that out themselves. \\nMention it, don’t insist. We’ll do our best but if they use a real snowbird and he gets \\ncaught, we won’t lift a finger. We’ll just tell t hem nothing can be done. But Barzini is a \\nman who will know that without being told. You notice how he never committed himself \\nin this affair. One might never have known he  was in any way concerned. That is a man \\nwho doesn’t get caught on the losing side.” \\nHagen was startled. “You mean he was behind So llozzo and Tattaglia all the time?” \\nDon Corleone sighed. “Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. \\nThat’s why I don’t have to know about what  happened. It’s enough to know that Barzini \\nhad a hand in it.” \\nHagen let this sink in. The Don was giving him clues but there was something very \\nimportant left out. Hagen knew what it was but he knew it was not hi s place to ask. He \\nsaid good night and turned to go. The Don had a last word for him. \\n“Remember, use all your wits for a plan to bring Michael home.” the Don said. “And one \\nother thing. Arrange with the telephone man so that every month I get a list of all the \\ntelephone calls, made and received, by Clemenza and Tessio. I suspect them of \\nnothing. I would swear they would never betray me. But there’s no harm in knowing any \\nlittle thing that may help us before the event.” \\nHagen nodded and went ou t. He wondered if the Don was keeping a check on him also \\nin some way and then was ashamed of his su spicion. But now he was sure that in the \\nsubtle and complex mind of the Godfather a far-ranging plan of action was being \\ninitiated that made the day’s happenings no more than a tact ical retreat. And there was \\nthat one dark fact that  no one mentioned, that he himself had not dared to ask, that Don \\nCorleone ignored. All pointed to a day of reckoning in the future. \\n  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 253\\nChapter 21 \\nBut it was to be nearly another year bef ore Don Corleone could arrange for his son \\nMichael to be smuggled back into the United St ates. During that time the whole Family \\nracked their brains for suitable schemes. Even Carlo Rizzi was listened to now that he \\nwas living in the mall with C onnie. (During that time they had a second child, a boy.) But \\nnone of the schemes met wit h the Don’s approval. \\nFinally it was the Bocchicchio Family who through a misfortune of its own solved the \\nproblem. There was one Bocchicch io, a young cousin of no more than twenty-five years \\nof age, named Felix, who was bo rn in America and with more brains than anyone in the \\nclan had ever had before. He had refused to be drawn into the Family garbage hauling \\nbusiness and married a nice American girl of E nglish stock to further his split from the \\nclan. He went to school at night, to becom e a lawyer, and worked during the day as a \\ncivil service post office clerk. During that time he had three child ren but his wife was a \\nprudent manager and they lived on his salary until he got his law degree. \\nNow Felix Bocchicchio, like ma ny young men, thought that having struggled to complete \\nhis education and master the to ols of his profession, his virtue would automatically be \\nrewarded and he would ear n a decent living. This proved not  to be the case. Still proud, \\nhe refused all help from his clan. But a lawy er friend of his, a young man well connected \\nand with a budding career in a big law firm, talk ed Felix into doing hi m a little favor. It \\nwas very complicated, seemingly legal, and had to do with a bankrup tcy fraud. It was a \\nmillion-to-one shot against its being found out. Felix Bocchicchio took the chance. Since \\nthe fraud involved using the legal skills he had learned in a university, it seemed not so \\nreprehensible, and, in an odd way, not even criminal. \\nTo make a foolish story short, the fraud was discovered. The lawyer friend refused to \\nhelp Felix in any manner, refused to even answe r his telephone calls. The two principals \\nin the fraud, shrewd middle-aged businessmen who furiously blamed Felix \\nBocchicchio’s legal clumsiness for the plan going awry, pleaded guilty and cooperated \\nwith the state, naming Felix Bocchicchio as t he ringleader of the fraud and claiming he \\nhad used threats of violence to control thei r business and force them to cooperate with \\nhim in his fraudulent schemes. Testimony wa s given that linked Felix with uncles and \\ncousins in the Bocchiochio clan who had criminal records for strong-arm, and this \\nevidence was damning. The two businessmen got off with suspended sentences. Felix \\nBocchiochio was given a sentence of one to  five years and served three of them. The \\nclan did not ask help from any of the Fa milies or Don Corleone because Felix had  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 254\\nrefused to ask their help and had to be taught  a lesson: that mercy comes only from the \\nFamily, that the Family is more loya l and more to be trusted than society. \\nIn any case, Felix Bocchicchio was released fr om prison after serving three years, went \\nhome and kissed his wife and three children and lived peac efully for a year, and then \\nshowed that he was of the Bocchicchio clan after all. Without any attempt to conceal his \\nguilt, he procured a weapon, a pistol, and shot his lawyer  friend to death. He then \\nsearched out the two businessmen and calmly shot them both through the head as they \\ncame out of a luncheonette. He left the bodies  lying in the street  and went into the \\nluncheonette and ordered a cup of coffee which he drank while he waited for the police \\nto come and arrest him. \\nHis trial was swift and his judgment merciless. A member of  the criminal underworld had \\ncold bloodedly murdered state witnesses who had sent him to the prison he richly \\ndeserved. It was a flagrant flouting of soci ety and for once the public, the press, the \\nstructure of society and even soft-headed and so ft-hearted humanitarians  were united in \\ntheir desire to see Felix Bocchicchio in the electric chair. The governor of the state \\nwould no more grant him clemency than t he officials of the pound spare a mad dog, \\nwhich was the phrase of one of the governor’s closest politic al sides. The Bocchiochio \\nclan of course would spend whatever money  was needed for appeals to higher courts, \\nthey were proud of him now, but the conclusi on was certain. After the legal folderol, \\nwhich might take a little time, Felix Bocchicchio would die in the electric chair. \\nIt was Hagen who brought this case to the att ention of the Don at the request of one of \\nthe Bocchiochios who hoped th at something could be done for the young man. Don \\nCodeone curtly refused. He was not a magici an. People asked him the impossible. But \\nthe next day the Don called Hag en into his office and had him go over the case in the \\nmost intimate detail. When Hagen was fini shed, Don Corleone told him to summon the \\nhead of the Bocchicchio clan to the mall for a meeting. \\nWhat happened next had t he simplicity of genius. Don Co rleone guaranteed to the head \\nof the Bocchicchio clan that the wife a nd children of Felix Bocchicchio would be \\nrewarded with a handsom e pension. The money for this would be handed over to the \\nBocchicchio clan immediately. In turn, Felix must confess to the murder of Sollozzo and \\nthe police captain McCluskey. \\nThere were many details to be arranged. Felix Bocchicchio wo uld have to confess \\nconvincingly, that is, he would have to know some of the true details to confess to. Also  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 255\\nhe must implicate the police captain in narcoti cs. Then the waiter at  the Luna Restaurant \\nmust be persuaded to identify Feli x Bocchiochio as the murder er. This would take some \\ncourage, as the description would change r adically, Felix Bocchicchio being much \\nshorter and heavier. But Don Corleone would attend to that. Also since the condemned \\nman had been a great believer in higher e ducation and a colleg e graduate, he would \\nwant his children to go to co llege. And so a sum of money wo uld have to be  paid by Don \\nCorleone that would take care of the ch ildren’s college. Then the Bocchicchio clan had \\nto be reassured that there was no hope for cl emency on the original murders. The new \\nconfession of course would seal the man’s already almost certain doom. \\nEverything was arranged, the money pa id and suitable co ntact made with the \\ncondemned man so that he could be instructed and advis ed. Finally the plan was \\nsprung and the confession made  headlines in all the news papers. The whole thing was \\na huge success. But Don Corkone,  cautious as always, wa ited until Felix Bocchicchio \\nwas actually executed four months later bef ore finally giving t he command that Michael \\nCorleone could return home. \\nChapter 22 \\nLucy Mancini, a year after Sonny’s death, sti ll missed him terribly, grieved for him more \\nfiercely than any lover in any romance. And her dreams were not the insipid dreams of a \\nschoolgirl, her longings not the longings of a devoted wife. She was not rendered \\ndesolate by the loss of her “life’s companion,” or miss him becaus e of his stalwart \\ncharacter. She held no fond remembrances of  sentimental gifts, of girlish hero worship, \\nhis smile, the amused glint of his eyes when she said something endearing or witty. \\nNo. She missed him for the more important reason that he had been the only man in the \\nworld who could make her body achieve the act of love. And, in her youth and \\ninnocence, she still believed that he was the only man who could possibly do so. \\nNow a year later she sunned herself in the balmy Nevada air. At her feet the slender, \\nblond young man was playing with her toes. They  were at the side of the hotel pool for \\nthe Sunday afternoon and despite the people all around them his hand was sliding up \\nher bare thigh. \\n“Oh, Jules, stop,” Lucy said. “I thought doctors  at least weren’t as silly as other men.” \\nJules grinned at her. “I ’m a Las Vegas doctor.” He tickled the inside of her thigh and was \\namazed how just a little thing like that coul d excite her so powerfully. It showed on her \\nface though she tried to hide it. She was really  a very primitive, innocent girl. Then why  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 256\\ncouldn’t he make her come across? He ha d to figure that one out and never mind the \\ncrap about a lost love that could never be r eplaced. This was living tissue here under his \\nhand and living tissue required other living tiss ue. Dr. Jules Segal decided he would \\nmake the big push tonight at  his apartment. He’d wanted to make her come across \\nwithout any trickery but if tr ickery there had to be, he was the man for it. All in the \\ninterests of science of course. And, besides, this poor kid was dying for it. \\n“Jules, stop, please stop,” Lucy said. Her voice was trembling. \\nJules was immediately contrite. “OK, honey,”  he said. He put hi s head in her lap and \\nusing her soft thighs as a pillow, he took a little nap. He was amused at her squirming, \\nthe heat that registered fr om her loins and when she put her hand on his head to \\nsmooth his hair, he grasped her wris t playfully and held it loverl ike but really to feel her \\npulse. It was galloping. He’d get her tonight and he’d solve the myst ery, what the hell \\never it was. Fully confident, Dr. Jules Segal fell asleep. \\nLucy watched the people around the pool. She could never have imagined her life would \\nchange so in less than two years. She never regretted her “foolis hness” at Connie \\nCorleone’s wedding. It was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to her and \\nshe lived it over and over again in her dream s. As she lived over and over again the \\nmonths that followed. \\nSonny had visited her once a week, sometimes more, never less. The days before she \\nsaw him again her body was in torment. Thei r passion for each other was of the most \\nelementary kind, undiluted by poetry or any fo rm of intellectualism. It was love of the \\ncoarsest nature, a fleshly love, a love of tissue for opposing tissue. \\nWhen Sonny called to her he was coming she made certain there wa s enough liquor in \\nthe apartment and enough food fo r supper and breakfast becaus e usually he would not \\nleave until late the next morning. He wanted his fill of her as she wanted her fill of him. \\nHe had his own key and when he came in t he door she would fly into his massive arms. \\nThey would both be brutally dire ct, brutally primitive. During their first kiss they would be \\nfumbling at each other’s clothi ng and he would be lifting her in  the air, and she would be \\nwrapping her legs around his huge thighs. They would be making love standing up in \\nthe foyer of her apartment as if  they had to repeat their fi rst act of love together, and \\nthen he would carry her so to the bedroom. \\nThey would lie in bed making love. They w ould live together in t he apartment for sixteen \\nhours, completely naked. She would cook for him, enormous meals. Sometimes he  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 257\\nwould get phone calls obviously about business but she never even listened to the \\nwords. She would be too busy toying with his body, fondling it, kissing it, burying her \\nmouth in it. Sometimes when he got up to get a drink and he walked by her, she couldn’t \\nhelp reaching out to touch his naked body, hold him, make love to him as if those \\nspecial parts of his body were a plaything, a specially constr ucted, intricate but innocent \\ntoy revealing its known, but still surprising  ecstasies. At firs t she had been ashamed of \\nthese excesses on her part but soon saw that they pleased her lover, that her complete sensual enslavement to his body flattered him. In all this there was an animal \\ninnocence. They were happy together.. \\nWhen Sonny’s father was gunne d down in the street, she under stood for the first time \\nthat her lover might be in danger. Alone in her apartment, she did not weep, she wailed \\naloud, an animal wailing. When Sonny did not come to see her for almost three weeks \\nshe subsisted on sleeping pills, liquor a nd her own anguish. The pain she felt was \\nphysical pain, her body ached.  When he finally did come s he held on to his body at \\nalmost every moment. After that he came at least once a week until he was killed. \\nShe learned of his death through the newspaper accounts and that very same night she took a massive overdose of sl eeping pills. For some reason, instead of killing, the pills \\nmade her so ill that she staggered out into the hall of her apartment and collapsed in \\nfront of the elevator door where she was found and taken to the hospital. Her \\nrelationship to Sonny was not generally known so her case received only a few inches in \\nthe tabloid newspapers. \\nIt was while she was in the hospital that Tom Hagen came to see her and console her. It was Tom Hagen who arranged a job for her in Las Vegas working in flue hotel run by \\nSonny’s brother Freddie. It was Tom Hagen wh o told her that she would receive an \\nannuity from the Corleone Family, that Sonny  had made provisions for her. He had \\nasked her if she was pregnant, as if that were  the reason for her taking the pills and she \\nhad told him no. He asked her if Sonny had come to see her that fatal night or had \\ncalled that he would come to see her and she told him no, that Sonny had not called. \\nThat she was always home waiting for him w hen she finished working. And she had told \\nHagen the truth. ‘He’s the only man I could ever  love,” she said. “I can’t love anybody \\nelse.” She saw him smile a little but he also looked surprised. “Do you find that so \\nunbelievable?” she asked. “Wasn’t he the on e who brought you ho me when you were a \\nkid?” \\n“He was a different person,” Hagen said, “he grew up to be a different kind of man.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 258\\n“Not to me,” Lucy said. “Maybe to everybody else, but not to me.” She was still too weak \\nto explain how Sonny had never been anythi ng but gentle with her. He’d never been \\nangry with her, never even irritable or nervous. \\nHagen made all the arrangements for her to mo ve to Las Vegas. A rented apartment \\nwas waiting, he took her to t he airport himself and he made her  promise that if she ever \\nfelt lonely or if things didn’t go right, s he would call him and he would help her in any \\nway he could. \\nBefore she got on the plane she asked him hesitantly, “Does Sonny’s father know what \\nyou’re doing?” \\nHagen smiled, “I’m acting for him as well as m yself. He’s old-fashioned in these things \\nand he would never go against the legal wife of his son. But he feels that you were just a \\nyoung girl and Sonny should have  known better. And your taking all those pills shook \\neverybody up.” He didn’t explai n how incredible it was to a man like the Don that any \\nperson should try suicide. \\nNow, after nearly eighteen months in Las Vegas, she was surprised to find herself \\nalmost happy. Some nights she dreamed about  Sonny and lying awake before dawn \\ncontinued her dream wit h her own caresses until she could sleep again. She had not \\nhad a man since. But the life in Vegas agreed with her. She went swimming in the hotel \\npools, sailed on Lake Mead and drove through the desert on her day off. She became \\nthinner and this improved her figure. She wa s still voluptuous but more in the American \\nthan the old Italian style. She worked in the public relations section of the hotel as a \\nreceptionist and had nothing to do with Fr eddie though when he saw her he would stop \\nand chat a little. She was surprised at t he change in Freddie. He had become a ladies’ \\nman, dressed beautifully, and se emed to have a real flair for running a gambling resort. \\nHe controlled the hotel side, something no t usually done by casino owners. With the \\nlong, very hot summer seasons, or perhaps hi s more active sex life, he too had become \\nthinner and Hollywood tailoring made him look almost debonair in a deadly sort of way. \\nIt was after six months that Tom Hagen came out to see how she was doing. She had \\nbeen receiving a check for six h undred dollars a month, every month, in addition to her \\nsalary. Hagen explained that th is money had to be shown as coming from someplace \\nand asked her to sign complete powers of a ttorney so that he could channel the money \\nproperly. He also told her that as a matter of form she would be li sted as owner of five \\n“points” in the hotel in wh ich she worked. She would have to go through all the legal  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 259\\nformalities required by the Nevada laws but everything would be ta ken care of for her \\nand her own personal inconvenie nce would be at a minimum.  However she was not to \\ndiscuss this arrangement with anyone without his consent. She would be protected \\nlegally in every way and her money every mont h would be assured. If the authorities or \\nany law-enforcement agencies ever questioned her , she was to simply refer them to her \\nlawyer and she would not  be bothered any further. \\nLucy agreed. She understood what was happening but had no objections to how she \\nwas being used. It seemed a reasonable favor.  But when Hagen asked her to keep her \\neyes open around the hotel, keep an eye on  Freddie and on Freddie’s boss, the man \\nwho owned and operated the hotel, as a major st ockholder, she said to him, “Oh, Tom, \\nyou don’t want me to spy on Freddie?” \\nHagen smiled. “His father worries about Freddi e. He’s in fast co mpany with Moe Greene \\nand we just want to make sure he doesn’t get into any trouble.” He didn’t bother to \\nexplain to her that the Don had backed the bui lding of this hotel in the desert of Las \\nVegas not only to supply a haven for his son, but to get a foot in the door for bigger \\noperations. \\nIt was shortly after this interview that Dr . Jules Segal came to work as the hotel \\nphysician. He was very thin, very handsome and charming and seemed very young to \\nbe a doctor, at least to Lucy. She met hi m when a lump grew above her wrist on her \\nforearm. She worried about it for a few days, then one morning went to the doctor’s suite \\nof offices in the hotel. Two of the show gi rls from the chorus lin e were in the waiting \\nroom, gossiping with each other. They ha d the blond peach-colored prettiness Lucy \\nalways envied. They looked angelic. But one of the girls was saying, “I swear if I have \\nanother dose I’m giving up dancing.” \\nWhen Dr. Jules Segal ope ned his office door to motion one  of the show giris inside, \\nLucy was tempted to leave, and if it had been something more personal and serious she \\nwould have. Dr. Segal was wearing slacks and an open shirt. The horn-rimmed glasses \\nhelped and his quiet reserved manner, but t he impression he gave was an informal one, \\nand like many basically old-fashioned people, Lucy didn’t believe that medicine and \\ninformality mixed. \\nWhen she finally got into his office there wa s something so reassuring in his manner \\nthat all her misgivings fled. He spoke hardly at all and yet he was not brus que, and he \\ntook his time. When she asked him what the lu mp was he patiently ex plained that it was  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 260\\na quite common fibrous growth that could in no way be malignant or a cause for serious \\nconcern. He picked up a heavy medica l book and said, “Hold out your arm.” \\nShe held out her arm tentatively.  He smiled at her for the firs t time. “I’m going to cheat \\nmyself out of a surgical fee,” he said. “I’ll just smash it wit h this book and it will flatten \\nout. It may pop up again but if I remove it surg ically, you’ll be out of money and have to \\nwear bandages and all that. OK?” \\nShe smiled at him. For some reason she had an absolute trust in him. “OK,” she said. In \\nthe next instant she let out a yell as he brought down the heavy medi cal volume on her \\nforearm. The lump ha d flattened out, almost. \\n“Did it hurt that much?” he asked. \\n“No,” she said. She watched him completing her case history card. “Is that all?” \\nHe nodded, not paying any more attention to her. She left. \\nA week later he saw her in the coffee shop and sa t next to her at the counter. “How’s the \\narm?” he asked. \\nShe smiled at him. “Fine,” she said. “You’re pretty unorthodox but you’re pretty good.” \\nHe grinned at her. “You don’t know how unor thodox I am. And I didn’t know how rich \\nyou were. The Vegas Sun just published the list of point owners in the hotel and Lucy \\nMancini has a big ten point s. I could have made a fortune on that little bump.” \\nShe didn’t answer him, suddenly reminded of  Hagen’s warnings. He grinned again. \\n“Don’t worry, I know the score, you’re just one of the dummies, Vegas is full of them. \\nHow about seeing one of the shows with me t onight and I’ll buy you dinner. I’ll even buy \\nyou some roulette chips.” \\nShe was a little doubtful. He urged her. Finally she said, “I’d like to come but I’m afraid \\nyou might be disappointed by how the night ends . I’m not really a swinger like most of \\nthe girls here in Vegas.” \\n“That’s why I asked you,” Jules said cheerfully. “I’ve prescribed a night’s rest for myself.” \\nLucy smiled at him and said a little sadly, “Is it that obv ious?” He shook his head and \\nshe said, “OK, supper then, but I ’ll buy my own roulette chips.” \\nThey went to the supper s how and Jules kept her amused by describing different types \\nof bare thighs and breasts in medical term s; but without sneering,  all in good humor. \\nAfterward they played roulette together at the same wheel and won over a hundred  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 261\\ndollars. Still later they drove up to Boulder Dam in the moonlight and he tried to make \\nlove to her but when she resisted after a few kisses he knew that she really meant no \\nand stopped. Again he took his defeat with great good humor. “I  told you I wouldn’t.” \\nLucy said with half-guilty reproach. \\n“You would have been awfully insulted if I didn ’t even try,” Jules said. And she had to \\nlaugh because it was true. \\nThe next few months they became best friends.  It wasn’t love because they didn’t make \\nlove, Lucy wouldn’t let him. S he could see he was puzzled by her refusal but not hurt the \\nway most men would be and that made her trust him even more. She found out that \\nbeneath his professional doctor’s exterior he was wildly fun-loving and reckless. On \\nweekends he drove a souped-up MG in the California races.  When he took a vacation \\nhe went down into the interior of Mexico , the real wild country, he told her, where \\nstrangers were murdered for their shoes and life was as primitive as a thousand years \\nago. Quite accidentally she learned that  he was a surgeon and had been connected with \\na famous hospital in New York. \\nAll this made her more pooled than ever at his having taken the job at the hotel. When \\nshe asked him about it, Jules said, “You tell me  your dark secret and I’ll tell you mine. \\nShe blushed and let the matter drop. Jules didn’t pursue it either and their relationship \\ncontinued, a warm friendship that s he counted on more than she realized. \\n* * *  \\nNow, sitting at the side of the pool with Ju les’ blond head in her lap, she felt an \\noverwhelming tenderness for him. Her loins ached and without realizing it her fingers \\nsensuously stroked the skin of his neck. He  seemed to be sleeping, not noticing, and \\nshe became excited just by the feel of hi m against her. Suddenly he raised his head \\nfrom her lap and stood up. He took her by t he hand and led her over the grass on to the \\ncement walk. She followed him dutifully ev en when he led her into one of the cottages \\nthat held his private apartmen t. When they were inside he fixed them both big drinks. \\nAfter the blazing sun and her own sensuous  thoughts the drink went to her head and \\nmade her dizzy. Then Jules had his arms around her and their bodies, naked except for \\nscanty bathing suits, were pressed against each other. Lucy was murmuring. “Don’t,” \\nbut there was no conviction in her voice and Jules paid no attention to her. He quickly \\nstripped her bathing bra off so that he coul d fondle her heavy breasts, kissed them and \\nthen stripped off her bathing trunks and as he did so kept kissing her body, her rounded  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 262\\nbelly and the insides of her thighs. He stood up, struggling out of his own bathing shorts \\nand embracing her, and then, na ked in each other’s arms, t hey were lying on his bed \\nand she could feel him entering her and it was enough,  just the slight touch, for her to \\nreach her climax and then in the second afterward she could read in the motions of his \\nbody, his surprise. She felt the overwhel ming shame she had felt before she knew \\nSonny, but Jules was twisting her body over the edge of the bed, positioning her legs a \\ncertain way and she let him control her lim bs and her body, and then he was entering \\nher again and kissing her and this time she c ould feel him but more important she could \\ntell that he was feeling somethi ng too and coming to his climax. \\nWhen he rolled off her body, Lucy huddled into one corner of the bed and began to cry. \\nShe felt so ashamed. And then she was shocki ngly surprised to hear Jules laugh softly \\nand say, “You poor benighted Eye-talian girl, so  that’s why you kept refusing me all \\nthese months? You dope.” He said “you dope” with such friendly affection that she \\nturned toward him and he took her naked body against his saying, “You are medieval, \\nyou are positively medieval.” But the voic e was soothingly comforting as she continued \\nto weep. \\nJules lit a cigarette and put it  in her mouth so that she c hoked on the smoke and had to \\nstop crying. “Now listen to me,” he said, “i f you had had a decent modern raising with a \\nfamily culture that was part of the twentie th century your probl em would have been \\nsolved years ago. Now let me tell you what your problem is: it’s not the equivalent of \\nbeing ugly, of having bad skin and squinty eyes that facial surgery really doesn’t solve. \\nYour problem is like having a wart or a mole  on your chin, or an  improperly formed ear. \\nStop thinking of it in sexual terms. Stop thinking in your head that you have a big box no \\nman can love because it won’t give his penis the necessary friction. What you have is a \\npelvic malformation and what we  surgeons call a weakening of the pelvic floor. It usually \\ncomes after child-bearing but it can be simply bad bone structure. It’s a common \\ncondition and many women live a life of misery because of it when a simple operation could fix them up. Some women even commit suicide because of it. But I never figured \\nyou for that condition because yon have su ch a beautiful body. I thought it was \\npsychological, since I know your story, you told it to me often enough, you and Sonny. \\nBut let me give you a thorough physical examination and I can tell you just exactly how \\nmuch work will have to be done. Now go in and take a shower.” \\nLucy went in and took her shower. Patiently and over her protests, Jules made her lie on \\nthe bed, legs spread apart. He had an extra doctor’s bag in his apartment and it was  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 263\\nopen. He also had a small gl ass-topped table by the bed which held some other \\ninstruments. He was all busi ness now, examining her, sticki ng his fingers inside her and \\nmoving them around. She was beginning to feel humiliat ed when he kissed her on the \\nnavel and said, almost absentmindedly, “First  time I’ve enjoyed my work.” Then he \\nflipped her over and thrust a finger in her re ctum, feeling around, but  his other hand was \\nstroking her neck affectionately. When he was fi nished he turned her ri ght side up again, \\nkissed her tenderly on the m outh and said, “Baby, I’m going to build you a whole new \\nthing down there, and then I’ll tr y it out personally. It will be a medical first, I’ll be able to \\nwrite a paper on it for t he official journals.” \\nJules did everything with such good-humored affection, he so obviously cared for her, \\nthat Lucy got over her shame and embarrassm ent. He even had the medical textbook \\ndown off its shelf to show her a case like he r own and the surgical procedure to correct \\nit. She found herself quite interested. \\n“It’s a health thing too,” Jules said. “If you don’t get it corrected you’re going to have a \\nhell of a lot of trouble later on with your wh ole plumbing system. The structure becomes \\nprogressively weaker unless it’s correct ed by surgery. It’s a damn shame that \\nold-fashioned prudery keeps a lot of doctors from properly diagnosing and correcting the \\nsituation, and a lot of women from complaining about it.” \\n“Don’t talk about it, please don’t talk about it,” Lucy said. \\nHe could see that she was still to some extent ashamed of her secret, embarrassed by \\nher “ugly defect.” Though to his medically trained mind this seemed the height of \\nsilliness, he was sensitive enough to identify with her. It also put hi m on the right track to \\nmaking her feel better. \\n“OK, I know your secret so now I’ll tell y ou mine,” he said. “You al ways ask me what I’m \\ndoing in this town, one of the youngest and most  brilliant surgeons in the East.” He was \\nmocking some newspaper reports about himself. “The truth is that I’m an abortionist, \\nwhich in itself is not so bad, so is half t he medical profession; but I got caught. I had a \\nfriend, a doctor named Kennedy, we interned together, and he’s a rea lly straight guy but \\nhe said he’d help me. I understand Tom Hagen had told him if he ever needed help on \\nanything the Corleone Family was indebted to him. So he spoke to Hagen. The next \\nthing I know the charges were dropped, but the Medical Association and the Eastern \\nestablishment had me blacklis ted. So the Corleone Family got me this job out here. I \\nmake a good living. I do a job that has to be done. These sh ow girls are always getting  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 264\\nknocked up and aborting them is the easiest thi ng in the world if they come to me right \\naway. I curette ‘em like you scrape a frying pan. Freddie Corleone is a real terror. By my \\ncount he’s knocked up fifteen girls while I’ve been here. I’ve seriously considered giving \\nhim a father-to-son talk about sex. Especially since I’ve had to treat him three times for \\nclap and once for syphilis. Freddie is  the original bareback rider.” \\nJules stopped talking. He had been deliberately indiscreet, something he never did, so \\nthat Lucy would know that other people, including someone she knew and feared a little \\nlike Freddie Corleone, also  had shameful secrets. \\n“Think of it as a piece of elastic in your bod y that has lost its elasticity,” Jules said. “By \\ncutting out a piece, you make it tighter, snappier.” \\n“I’ll think about it,” Lucy said, but she was sure she was going to go through with it, she \\ntrusted Jules absolutely. Then she thought of something else. “How much will it cost?” \\nJules frowned. “I haven’t the facilities here for surgery like that and I’m not the expert at it. But I have a friend in Los Angeles who’s the best in the field and has facilities at the \\nbest hospital. In fact he tightens up all the movie stars, when those dames find out that \\ngetting their faces and breasts lifted isn’t t he whole answer to making a man love them. \\nHe owes me a few favors so it won’t cost anything. I do his abortions for him. Listen, if it weren’t unethical I’d tell y ou the names of some of t he movie sex queens who have had \\nthe operation.” \\nShe was immediately curious. “Oh, come on, tell me,” she said. “Come on.” It would be a delicious piece of gossip a nd one of the things about Juic e was that she could show \\nher feminine love of gossip without him making fun of it. \\n“I’ll tell you if you have dinner with me and spend the night with me,” Jules said. “We \\nhave a lot of lost time to make up for because of your silliness.” \\nLucy felt an overwhelming affect ion to him for being so kind  and she was able to say, \\n“You don’t have to sleep with me, you know y ou won’t enjoy it the way I am now.” \\nJules burst out laughing. “Y ou dope, you incredible dope. Didn’t you ever hear of any \\nother way of making love, far more ancient, far more civilized. Are you really that \\ninnocent?” \\n“Oh that,” she said.. \\n“Oh that,” he mimicked her. “Nice girls don’ t do that, manly men don’t do that. Even in \\nthe year 1948. Well, baby, I can take you to the house of a little old lady right here is Las  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 265\\nVegas who was the youngest madam of the mo st popular whorehouse in the wild west \\ndays, back is 1880, I think it was. She likes to talk about the old days. You know what \\nshe told me? That these gunslingers, those manly, virile, straight-shooting cowboys \\nwould always ask the girls for a ‘French,’ what we actors call fellatio, what you call ‘oh \\nthat.’ Did you ever think of doing ‘oh that’ with your beloved Sonny?” \\nFor the first time she truly surprised him. Sh e turned on him with what he could think of \\nonly as a Mona Lisa smile (his scientific mind immediately darting off on a tangent, could \\nthis be the solving of that c enturies-old mystery?) and said quietly, “I did everything with \\nSonny.” It was the first ti me she had ever admitted anything like that to anyone. \\nTwo weeks later Jules Segal stood in the oper ating room of the Lo s Angeles hospital \\nand watched his friend Dr. Frederick Kellner perform the specialty. Before Lucy was put \\nunder anesthesia, Jules leaned over and whispered, “I told him you were my special girl \\nso he’s going to put in some real tight wa lls.” But the preliminar y pill had already made \\nher dopey and she didn’t la ugh or smile. His teasing remark did take away some of the \\nterror of the operation. \\nDr. Kellner made his incision with the conf idence of a pool shark making an easy shot. \\nThe technique of any operation to str engthen the pelvic floor required the \\naccomplishment of two objectives. The muscul ofibrous pelvic sling had to be shortened \\nso that the slack was taken up. And of course  the vaginal opening, the weak spot itself \\nin the pelvic floor, had to be brought forw ard, brought under the pubic arch and so \\nrelieved from the line of dire ct pressure above. Repairin g the pelvic slin g was called \\nperincorrhaphy. Suturing the vaginal wall was called colporrhaphy. \\nJules saw that Dr. Kellner was working carefu lly now, the big danger in the cutting was \\ngoing too deep and hitting the rect um. It was a fairly unco mplicated case, Jules had \\nstudied all the X rays and tests. Nothing s hould go wrong except that in surgery \\nsomething could always go wrong. \\nKellner was working on the di aphragm sling, the T forceps held the vaginal flap, and \\nexposing the ani muscle and the fasci which formed its sheath. Kellner’s gauze-covered \\nfingers were pushing aside loose connective tiss ue. Jules kept his eyes on the vaginal \\nwall for the appearance of the veins, the telltal e danger signal of injuring the rectum. But \\nold Kellner knew his stuff. He was building a new snatch as easily as a carpenter nails \\ntogether two-by-four studs. \\nKenner was trimming away the excess vaginal wall using th e fastening-down stitch to  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 266\\nclose the “bite” taken out of the tissue of the redundant angle,  insuring that no \\ntroublesome projections would form. Kellner wa s trying to insert three fingers into the \\nnarrowed opening of the lumen, then two. He  just managed to get two fingers in, probing \\ndeeply and for a moment he looked up at Jules and his china-blue eyes over the gauze \\nmask twinkled as though asking if that  was narrow enough. Th en he was busy again \\nwith his sutures. \\nIt was all over. They wheeled Lucy out to the recovery room and Jules talked to Kellner. \\nKellner was cheerful, the best sign that everything had gone well. “No complications at \\nall, my boy,” he told Jules. “Nothing growing in there, very simple case. She has wonderful body tone, unusual in these cases and now she’s in first-class shape for fun \\nand games. I envy you, my boy. Of course you’ll have to wait a little while but then I guarantee you’ll like my work.” \\nJules laughed. “You’re a true Pygmalion,  Doctor. Really, you were marvelous.” \\nDr. Kellner grunted. “That ’s all child’s play, like your a bortions. If society would only be \\nrealistic, people like you and I, really talent ed people, could do important work and leave \\nthis stuff for the hacks. By the way, I’ll be s ending you a girl next week, a very nice girl, \\nthey seem to be the ones who always get in tr ouble. That will make us all square for this \\njob today.” \\nJules shook his hand. “Thanks, Doctor. Come out yourself sometime and I’ll see that \\nyou get all the courtesies of the house.” \\nKellner gave him a wry smile. “I gamble ever y day, I don’t need your roulette wheels and \\ncrap tables. I knock heads with fate too often as  it is. You’re going to waste out there, \\nJules. Another couple of years and you can forget about serious surgery. You won’t be \\nup to it.” He turned away. \\nJules knew it was not meant as  a reproach but as a warning. Yet it took the heart out of \\nhim anyway. Since Lucy wouldn’t be out of the recovery room for at least twelve hours, \\nhe went out on the town and got drunk. Part of getting drunk was his feeling of relief that \\neverything had worker out so well with Lucy. \\n* * *  \\nThe next morning when he went to the hospita l to visit her he was surprised to find two \\nmen at her bedside and flowers all over the room. Lucy was propped up on pillows, her \\nface radiant. Jules was surprised because Lucy had broken with her family and had told him not to notify them unless something went wrong. Of course Freddie Corleone knew  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 267\\nshe was in the hospital for a minor operation; that had been necessary so that they both \\ncould get time off, and Freddie had told Jules that the hotel would pick up all the bills for \\nLucy. \\nLucy was introducing them and one of the men Jules recogni zed instantly. The famous \\nJohnny Fontane. The other was a big, muscular, snotty-looking Italian guy whose name \\nwas Nino Valenti. They both shook hands with Jule s and then paid no further attention \\nto him. They were kidding Lucy, talking abo ut the old neighborhood in New York, about \\npeople and events Jules had no way of sharing. So  he said to Lucy, “I’ll drop by later, I \\nhave to see Dr. Kellner anyway.” \\nBut Johnny Fontane was turning the charm on him. “Hey, buddy, we have to leave \\nourselves, you keep Lucy company. Take good care of her, Doc.” Jules noticed a \\npeculiar hoarseness in Johnny Fontane’s voic e and remembered suddenly that the man \\nhadn’t sung in public for over a year now, that he had won the Academy Award for his \\nacting. Could the man’s voic e have changed so late in life and the papers keeping it a \\nsecret, everybody keeping it a secret? Jules loved inside gossip and kept listening to \\nFontane’s voice in an attempt to diagnose the trouble. It coul d be simple strain, or too \\nmuch booze and cigarettes or even too much women. The voice had an ugly timbre to it, \\nhe could never be called the sweet crooner anymore. \\n“You sound like you have a cold,” Jules said to Johnny Fontane. \\nFontane said politely, “Just strain, I tried to sing last night. I guess I just can’t accept the \\nfact that my voice changed, getting old you know.” He gave Jules a what-the-hell grin. \\nJules said casually, “Didn’t y ou get a doctor to look at it? Maybe it’s something that can \\nbe fixed.” \\nFontane was not so charming now.  He gave Jules a long cool look. “That’s the first thing \\nI did nearly two years ago. Best specialists. My own doctor who’s supposed to be the top guy out here in California. They told me to get a lot of rest. Nothing wrong, just \\ngetting older. A man’s voice changes when he gets older.” \\nFontane ignored him after that, paying attention to Lucy, charming her as he charmed all \\nwomen. Jules kept listening to the voice. Th ere had to be a growth on those vocal cords. \\nBut then why the hell hadn’t the specialists spotted it? Wa s it malignant and inoperable? \\nThen there was other stuff. \\nHe interrupted Fontane to ask, “When was the last time you got examined by a \\nspecialist?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 268\\nFontane was obviously irritated but trying. to be polite for Lucy’s sake. “About eighteen \\nmonths ago.” he said. \\n“Does your own doctor take a look once in a while?” Jules asked. \\n“Sure he does,” Johnny Fontane said irritabl y. “He gives me a codeine spray and checks \\nme out. He told me it’s just my voice aging, that all the drinki ng and smoking and other \\nstuff. Maybe you know  more than he does?” \\nJules asked, “What’s his name?” \\nFontane said with just a faint flicker of pri de, “Tucker, Dr. James Tucker. What do you \\nthink of him?” \\nThe name was familiar, linked to famous mo vie stars, female, and to an expensive \\nhealth farm. \\n“He’s a sharp dresser,” Jules said with a grin. \\nFontane was angry now. “You think you’re a better doctor than he is?” \\nJules laughed. “Are you a better singer th an Carmen Lombardo?” He was surprised to \\nsee Nino Valenti break  up in laughter, banging his head on his chair. The joke hadn’t \\nbeen that good. Then on the wings of those guffaws he caught the smell of bourbon and \\nknew that even this early in the morning Mr.  Valenti, whoever the hell he was, was at \\nleast half drunk. \\nFontane was grinning at his friend. “Hey, you’re supposed to be laughing at my jokes, \\nnot his.” Meanwhile Lucy stretched out her hand to Jules and drew him to her bedside. \\n“He looks like a bum but he’s a brilliant surg eon,” LUCY told them. “If he says he’s better \\nthan Dr. Tucker then he’s better than Dr. Tucker. You listen to him, Johnny.” \\nThe nurse came in and told them they would have to leave. The resident was going to do some work on Lucy and needed privacy. Jules was amused to see Lucy turn her \\nhead away so when Johnny Fontane and Nino Va lenti kissed her they would hit her \\ncheek instead of her m outh, but they seemed to expect it. She let Jules kiss her on the \\nmouth and whispered, “Come back th is afternoon, please?” he nodded. \\nOut in the corridor, Valenti asked him, “What  was the operation for? Anything serious?” \\nJules shook his head. “Just a little female plum bing. Absolutely routine, please believe \\nme. I’m more concerned than you ar e, I hope to marry the girl.” \\nThey were looking at him appraisingly so he a sked, “How did you find out she was in the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 269\\nhospital?” \\n“Freddie called us and asked us to look in,” Fontane said. “We all grew up in the same \\nneighborhood. Lucy was maid  of honor when Freddie’s sister got married.” \\n“Oh,” Jules said. He didn’t let on that he knew the whole story, perhaps because they \\nwere so cagey about protecting Lucy and her affair with Sonny. \\nAs they walked down the corridor, Jules sa id to Fontane, “I have visiting doctor’s \\nprivileges here, why don’t you let me  have a look at your throat?” \\nFontane shook his head. “I’m in a hurry.” \\nNino Valenti said, “That’s a million-dollar throat, he can’t have cheap doctors looking down it.” Jules saw Valenti was gri nning at him, obviously on his side. \\nJules said cheerfully, “I’m no cheap docto r. I was the brightest young surgeon and \\ndiagnostician on the East Coast unt il they got me on an abortion rap.” \\nAs he had known it would, that  made them take him seriously. By admitting his crime he \\ninspired belief in his claim of high competence. Valenti re covered first. “ If Johnny can’t \\nuse you, I got a girl friend I want you to look at, not at her throat though.” \\nFontane said to him nervously, “How long will you take?” \\n“Ten minutes,” Jules said. It was a lie but he believed in telling lies to people. Truth telling and medicine just didn’t go together e xcept in dire emergencies, if then. \\n“OK,” Fontane said. His voice was darker, hoarser, with fright. \\nJules recruited a nurse and a consulting ro om. It didn’t have everything he needed but \\nthere was enough. In less than ten minutes he knew there was a growth on the vocal \\ncords, that was easy. Tucker, that incompet ent sartorial son of a bitch of a Hollywood \\nphony, should have been able to spot it. Christ, maybe the guy didn’t even have a \\nlicense and if he did it should be taken away from him. Jule s didn’t pay any attention to \\nthe two men now. He picked up the phone and ask ed for the throat man at the hospital \\nto come down. Then he swung around and said to Nino Valenti, “I think it might be a \\nlong wait for you, you’d better leave.” \\nFontane stared at him in utter disbelief. “You so n of a bitch, you think you’re going to \\nkeep me here? You think you’re going to fuck around with my throat?” \\nJules, with more pleasure than he would have t hought possible, gave it to him straight \\nbetween the eyes. “You can do whatever you like,” he said. “You’ve got a growth of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 270\\nsome sort on your vocal cords, in your larynx. If you stay here th e next few hours, we \\ncan nail it down, whether it’s  malignant or nonmalignant. We  can make a decision for \\nsurgery or treatment. I can give  you the whole story. I can give you the name of a top \\nspecialist in America and we can have hi m out here on the plane tonight, with your \\nmoney that is, and if I think it necessary. But you can walk out of here and see your \\nquack buddy or sweat while you decide to see another doctor, or get referred to \\nsomebody incompetent. Then if it’s maligna nt and gets big enough they’ll cut out your \\nwhole larynx or you’ll die. Or  you can just sweat. Stick here with me and we can get it all \\nsquared away in a few hours. You got anything more important to do?” \\nValenti said, “Let’s stick around,  Johnny, what the hel l. I’ll go down the hall and call the \\nstudio. I won’t tell them anything, just t hat we’re held up. Then I’ll come back here and \\nkeep you company.” \\nIt proved to be a very long afternoon but a re warding one. The diagn osis of the staff \\nthroat man was perfectly sound as far as  Jules could see after the X rays and swab \\nanalysis. Halfway through, Johnn y Fontane, his mouth soaked wi th iodine, retching over \\nthe roll of gauze stuck in hi s mouth, tried to gait. Nino Valenti grabbed him by the \\nshoulders and slammed him back into a chair.  When it was all over Jules grinned at \\nFontane and said, “Warts.” \\nFontane didn’t grasp it. Jules said again. “Just some warts. We’ll slice them right off like \\nskin off baloney. In a few months you’ll be OK.” \\nValenti let out a yell but Font ane was still frowning. “How about singing afterward, how \\nwill it affect my singing?” \\nJules shrugged. “On that ther e’s no guarantee. But since you can’t sing now what’s the \\ndifference?” \\nFontane looked at him wit h distaste. “Kid, you don’t know what the hell you’re talking \\nabout. You act like you’re giving me good news when what you’re telling me is maybe I \\nwon’t sing anymore. Is that right , maybe I won’t sing anymore?” \\nFinally Jules was disgus ted. He’d operated as a real doct or and it had been a pleasure. \\nHe had done this bastard a real favor and he was acting as if he’d been done dirt. Jules \\nsaid coldly, “Listen, Mr. Fontane, I’m a doctor of medicine and yo u can call me Doctor, \\nnot kid. And I did give you very good news. When I brought you down here I was certain \\nthat you had a malignant growth in your lary nx which would entail cutting out your whole \\nvoice box. Or which could kill you. I was wo rried that I might have to tell you that you  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 271\\nwere a dead man. And I was so delighted when I could say the word ‘warts.’ Because \\nyour singing gave me so much pleasure, helped me seduce girls when I was younger \\nand you’re a real artist. But also you’re a ve ry spoiled guy. Do you think because you’re \\nJohnny Fontane you can’t get cancer? Or a brain tumor that’s inoperable. Or a failure of \\nthe heart? Do you think you’re never going to die? Well, it’s not all sweet music and if \\nyou want to see real trouble take a walk thr ough this hospital and you’ll sing a love song \\nabout warts. So just stop the crap and get on with what you have to do. Your Adolphe \\nMenjou medical man can get y ou the proper surgeon but if he  tries to get into the \\noperating room I suggest you have hi m arrested for atte mpted murder.” \\nJules started to walk out of the room w hen Valenti said, “Attaboy, Doc, that’s telling \\nhim.” \\nJules whirled around and said, “Do y ou always get looped before noontime?” \\nValenti said, “Sure,” and gri nned at him and with such good hum or that Jules said more \\ngently than he had meant to, “You have to figure you’ll be dead in five years if you keep \\nthat up.” \\nValenti was lumberin g up to him with little dancing st eps. He threw his arms around \\nJules, his breath stank of bourbon. He wa s laughing very hard. “Five years?” he asked \\nstill’ laughing. “Is it goi ng to take that long?” \\n* * *  \\nA month after her operation Lucy Mancini sa t beside the Vegas hotel pool, one hand \\nholding a cocktail, the other hand stroking Jules’ head, which lay in her lap. \\n“You don’t have to build up your courage,” Jules said teasingly. “I have champagne \\nwaiting in our suite.” \\n“Are you sure it’s OK so soon?” Lucy asked. \\n“I’m the doctor,” Jules said. “Tonight’s the big night. Do you realize I’ll be the first \\nsurgeon in medical history who tried out the results of his ‘medical first’ operation? You \\nknow, the Before and After. I’ m going to enjoy writing it up  for the journals. Let’s see, \\n‘while the Before was distinctly pleasur able for psychological reasons and the \\nsophistication of the sur geon-instructor, the post-operat ive coitus was extremely \\nrewarding strictly for its neurological”– he stopped talking because Lucy had yanked on his hair hard enough for him to yell with pain. \\nShe smiled down at him. “If you’re not satisfi ed tonight I can really say it’s your fault,”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 272\\nshe said. \\n“I guarantee my work. I planned it even though I just let old Kellner do the manual labor,” \\nJules said. “Now let’s just rest up, we have a long night of research ahead.” \\nWhen they went up to their suite– they were living together now– Lucy found a surprise \\nwaiting: a gourmet supper and next to he r champagne glass, a jeweler’s box with a \\nhuge diamond engagement ring inside it. \\n“That shows you how much confidence I have in my work,” Jules said. “Now let’s see \\nyou earn it.” \\nHe was very tender, very gentle with her. She was a little scary at first, her flesh jumping away from his touch but then, reassured, she felt her body building up to a passion she \\nhad never known, and when they were done t he first time and Jules whispered, “I do \\ngood work,” she whispered back, “Oh, yes, y ou do; yes, you do.” And they both laughed \\nto each other as they st arted making love again. \\nBook Six  \\nChapter 23 \\nAfter five months of exile in Sicily, Mi chael Corleone came finally to understand his \\nfather’s character and his destiny. He came to understand men like Luca Brasi, the \\nruthless caporegime Clemenza, his mother’s resignation and acceptance of her role. For \\nin Sicily he saw what they would have been if they had chosen not to struggle against \\ntheir fate. He understood why the Don always said, “A man has only one destiny.” He \\ncame to understand the contem pt for authority and legal government, the hatred for any \\nman who broke omerta, the law of silence. \\nDressed in old clothes and a billed cap, Michael had been tr ansported from the ship \\ndocked at Palermo to the interi or of the Sicilian island, to the very heart of a province \\ncontrolled by the Mafia, where the local capo -mafioso was greatly indebted to his father \\nfor some past service. The province held the town of Corleone, whose name the Don \\nhad taken when he emigrated to America so long ago. But there were no longer any of the Don’s relatives alive. The women had died of old age. All the men had been killed in \\nvendettas or had also emigrated, either to Am erica, Brazil or to some other province on \\nthe Italian mainland. He was to learn later t hat this small poverty-stricken town had the \\nhighest murder rate of any place in the world. \\nMichael was installed as a guest in the home of a bachelor uncle of the capo-mafioso.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 273\\nThe uncle, in his seventies, wa s also the doctor for the di strict. The capo-mafioso was a \\nman in his late fifties named Don Tommasi no and he operated as the gabbellotto for a \\nhuge estate belonging to one of Sicily’s most noble families. The gabbellotto, a sort of \\noverseer to the estates of the rich, also guaranteed that the poor wo uld not try to claim \\nland not being cultivated, w ould not try to encroach in any way on the estate, by \\npoaching or trying to farm it as squatters. In  short, the gabbellotto wa s a mafioso who for \\na certain sum of money protected the real estate  of the rich from all claims made on it by \\nthe poor, legal or illegal. When any poor peasant tried to  implement the law which \\npermitted him to buy uncultivated land, the gabbellotto frightened him off with threats of \\nbodily harm or death. It was that simple. \\nDon Tommasino also controlled the water rights in the area and vetoed the local \\nbuilding of any new dams by the Roman government. Such dams would ruin the \\nlucrative business of selling water from the artesian wells he controlled, make water too \\ncheap, ruin the whole important water economy so labori ously built up over hundreds of \\nyears. However, Don Tommasino was an old-fashioned Mafia chief and would have \\nnothing to do with dope traffic or prostitution . In this Don Tommasino was at odds with \\nthe new breed of Mafia leaders springing up in  big cities like Pa lermo, new men who, \\ninfluenced by American gangsters deported to Italy, had no such scruples. \\nThe Mafia chief was an extremely portly man, a “man with a belly,” liter ally as well as is \\nthe figurative sense that meant  a man able to inspire fear in his fellow men. Under his \\nprotection, Michael had nothing to fear, yet it was considered necessary to keep the \\nfugitive’s identity a secret. And so Michael was restricted to the walled estate of Dr. \\nTaza, the Don’s uncle. \\nDr. Taza was tall for a Sicilian, almost six feet, and had ruddy cheeks and snow-white \\nhair. Though in his seventies, he went every w eek to Palermo to pay his respects to the \\nyounger prostitutes of that city, the younger  the better. Dr. Taza’s other vice was \\nreading. He read everything and talked about what he read to his fellow townsmen, \\npatients who were illiterate peasants, the estate shepherds, and this gave him a local \\nreputation for foolishness. What  did books have to do with them? \\nIn the evenings Dr. Taza, Don Tommasino and Michael sat in the huge garden populated with these marble stat ues that on this island seemed to grow out of the \\ngarden as magically as the black heady grapes. Dr. Taza loved to tell stories about the Mafia and its exploits over the centuries an d in Michael Corleone he had a fascinated \\nlistener. There were times when even Don Tommasino would be carried away by the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 274\\nbalmy air, the fruity, intoxicating wine, t he elegant and quiet comfor t of the garden, and \\ntell a story from his own practical experienc e. The doctor was the legend, the Don the \\nreality. \\nIn this antique garden, Michael  Corleone learned about  the roots from which his father \\ngrew. That the word “Mafia” had originally m eant place of refuge. Then it became the \\nname for the secret organization that spr ang up to fight against the rulers who had \\ncrushed the country and its people for centurie s. Sicily was a land that had been more \\ncruelly raped than any other in history. The Inquisition had tortured rich and poor alike. \\nThe landowning barons and the princes of t he Catholic Church exercised absolute \\npower over the shepherds and farmers. The po lice were the instruments of their power \\nand so identified with them that  to be called a policeman is t he foulest insult one Sicilian \\ncan hurl at another. \\nFaced with the savagery of this absolute po wer, the suffering people learned never to \\nbetray their anger and their hatred for fear of being crushed. They learned never to \\nmake themselves vulnerable by uttering any sort of threat since giving such a warning \\ninsured a quick reprisal. They learned that  society was their enemy and so when they \\nsought redress for their wrongs they went to  the rebel underground,  the Mafia. And the \\nMafia cemented its power by originating t he law of silence, the omerta. In the \\ncountryside of Sicily a str anger asking directions to the nearest town will not even \\nreceive the courtesy of an answer. And the greatest crime any member of the Mafia \\ncould commit would be to tell the police the name of the man who had just shot him or \\ndone him any kind of injury. Omerta became t he religion of the people. A woman whose \\nhusband has been murdered would not tell the police the name of her husband’s \\nmurderer, not even of her child’s  murderer,, her  daughter’s raper. \\nJustice had never been forthcoming from the authorities and so  the people had always \\ngone to the Robin Hood Mafia. And to some ex tent the Mafia still fulfilled this role. \\nPeople turned to their local capo-mafioso fo r help in every emergency. He was their \\nsocial worker, their district captain ready wit h a basket of food and a j ob, their protector. \\nBut what Dr. Taza did not add, what Michael learned on his own in  the months that \\nfollowed, was that the Mafia in  Sicily had become the illegal arm of the rich and even the \\nauxiliary police of the legal and political structure. It had become a degenerate capitalist \\nstructure, anti-communist, ant i-liberal, placing its own ta xes on every form of business \\nendeavor no matter how small.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 275\\nMichael Corleone understood for t he first time why men like his father chose to become \\nthieves and murderers rather than members of  the legal society. The poverty and fear \\nand degradation were too awful to be acceptable to any man of spirit. And in America \\nsome emigrating Sicilians had assumed t here would be an equally cruel authority. \\nDr. Taza offered to take Mic hael into Palermo with him on his weekly visit to the bordello \\nbut Michael refused. His flig ht to Sicily had prevented him from getting proper medical \\ntreatment for his smashed ja w and he now carried a mement o from Captain McCluskey \\non the left side of his face. The bones had kn itted badly, throwing his profile askew, \\ngiving him the appearance of depravity when viewed from th at side. He had always \\nbeen vain about his looks and this upset him more than he thought possible. The pain \\nthat came and went he didn’t mind at all, Dr. Taza gave him some pills that deadened it. \\nTaza offered to treat his face but Michael refused. He had been there long enough to \\nlearn that Dr. Taza was perhaps the worst ph ysician in Sicily. Dr. Taza read everything \\nbut his medical literature, which he adm itted he could not understand. He had passed \\nhis medical exams through the good offices of the most important Mafia chief in Sicily \\nwho had made a special trip to Palermo to c onfer with Taza’s prof essors about what \\ngrades they should give him. And this t oo showed how the Mafia in Sicily was \\ncancerous to the society it inhabited. Merit meant  nothing. Talent meant nothing. Work \\nmeant nothing. The Mafia Godfather gave you your profession as a gift. \\nMichael had plenty of time to think things  out. During the day he took walks in the \\ncountryside, always accompanied by two of the shepherds attached to Don Tommasino’s estate. The shepherds of the isla nd were often recruited to act as the \\nMafia’s hired killers and did their job simply to earn money to live. Michael thought about \\nhis father’s organization. If it  continued to prosper it woul d grow into what had happened \\nhere on this island, so cancerous that it would destroy the whole country. Sicily was \\nalready a land of ghosts, its men emigrating to every other country on earth to be able to \\nearn their bread, or simply to escape being murdered for exercising their political and \\neconomic freedoms. \\nOn his long walks the most striking thing in Michael’s eyes was the magnificent beauty of the country; he walked through the orange or chards that formed shady deep caverns \\nthrough the countryside with their ancient c onduits splashing water out of the fanged \\nmouths of great snake stones  carved before Christ. Houses built like ancient Roman \\nvillas, with huge marble portals and great vault ed rooms, falling into ruins or inhabited by \\nstray sheep. On the horizon the bony hills shone like pi cked bleached bones piled high.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 276\\nGardens and fields, sparkly green, decorat ed the desert landscape like bright emerald \\nnecklaces. And sometimes he walked as far as the town of Corleone, its eighteen \\nthousand people strung out in dw ellings that pitted the side of the nearest mountain, the \\nmean hovels built out of black rock quarried from t hat mountain. In the last year there \\nhad been over sixty murders in Corleone and it seemed that death shadowed the town. \\nFurther on, the wood of Ficuzza broke the savage monotony of arable plain. \\nHis two shepherd bodyguards always carri ed their luparas with them when \\naccompanying Michael on his walks. The deadly Sicilian shotgun was the favorite \\nweapon of the Mafia. Indeed the police chief sent by Mussolini to clean the Mafia out of \\nSicily had, as one of his first steps, ordered all stone walls in  Sicily to be knocked down \\nto not more than three feet in height so th at murderers with their luparas could not use \\nthe walls as ambush points for their assassinati ons. This didn’t help much and the police \\nminister solved his problem by arresting and deporting to penal colonies any male \\nsuspected of being a mafioso. \\nWhen the island of Sicily wa s liberated by the Allied Armies, the American military \\ngovernment officials believed that anyone imprisoned by the Fa scist regime was a \\ndemocrat and many of these mafiosi were appointed as mayors  of villages or \\ninterpreters to the military government . This good fortune enabled the Mafia to \\nreconstitute itself and become more formidable than ever before. \\nThe long walks, a bottle of strong wine at night with a heavy plate of pasta and meat, \\nenabled Michael to sleep. There were books in  Italian in Dr. Taza’s library and though \\nMichael spoke dialect Italian and had taken some  college courses in Italian, his reading \\nof these books took a great  deal of effort and time. His speech became almost \\naccentiess and, though he could never pass as  a native of the district, it would be \\nbelieved that he was one of thos e strange Italians from the far north of Italy bordering \\nthe Swiss and Germans. \\nThe distortion of the left side  of his face made him more native. It was the kind of \\ndisfigurement common in Sicily because of the lack of medical care. The little injury that \\ncannot lie patched up simply for lack of m oney. Many children, many men, bore \\ndisfigurements that in America would have been repaired by minor surgery or \\nsophisticated medi cal treatments. \\nMichael often thought of Kay,  of her smile, her body, and always felt a twinge o \\nconscience at leaving her so brutally wi thout a word of fa rewell. Oddly enough his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 277\\nconscience was never troubled by the two men he had murdered; Sollozzo had tried to \\nkill his father, Captain McCluskey had disfigured him for life. \\nDr. Taza always kept after him about getting surgery done for his lopsided face, \\nespecially when Michael asked hi m for pain-killing drugs, the pain getting worse as time \\nwent on, and more frequent. Taza explained that  there was a facial nerve below the eye \\nfrom which radiated a whole complex of nerv es. Indeed, this was the favorite spot for \\nMafia torturers, who searched it out on the cheeks of thei r victims with the needle-fine \\npoint of an ice pick. That particular nerve in Michael’s fee had been injured or perhaps there was a splinter of bone lanced into it. Si mple surgery in a Palermo hospital would \\npermanently relieve the pain. \\nMichael refused. When the doctor asked why, Michael grinned and said, “It’s something from home.” \\nAnd he really didn’t mind t he pain, which was more an ache,  a small throbbing in his \\nskull, like a motored apparatus running in liquid to purify it. \\nIt was nearly seven months of leisurely rustic living before Michael felt real boredom. At \\nabout this time Don Tommasino became very busy and was seldom seen at the villa. He \\nwas having his troubles with the “new Mafia”  springing up in Pa lermo, young men who \\nwere making a fortune out of the postwar constr uction boom in that city. With this wealth \\nthey were trying to encroach on the countr y fiefs of oldtime Ma fia leaders whom they \\ncontemptuously labeled Moustache Pete s. Don Tommasino was kept busy defending \\nhis domain. And so Michael was deprived of the old man’s company and had to be \\ncontent with Dr. Taza’s stories, which were beginning to repeat themselves. \\nOne morning Michael decided to take a long  hike to the mountains beyond Corleone. He \\nwas, naturally, accompanied by the two shepherd bodyguards. This was not really a \\nprotection against enemies of the Corleone  Family. It was simply too dangerous for \\nanyone not a native to go wandering about by  himself. It was dangerous enough for a \\nnative. The region was loaded with bandits, with Mafia parti sans fighting against each \\nother and endangering every body else in the process. He  might also be mistaken for a \\npagliaio thief. \\nA pagliaio is a straw-thatched but erected in the fields to house farming tools and to \\nprovide shelter for the agricultural laborers so  that they will not hav e to carry them on \\nthe long walk from their homes in the village . In Sicily the peasant does not live on the \\nland he cultivates. It is too dangerous and any arable land, if he owns it, is too precious.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 278\\nRather, he lives in his village  and at sunrise begins his voya ge out to work in distant \\nfields, a commuter on foot. A worker who arri ved at his pagliaio a nd found it looted was \\nan injured man indeed. The bread was taken out  of his mouth for that day. The Mafia, \\nafter the law proved helpless, took this interest of the peasant un der its protection and \\nsolved the problem in typical fashion.  It hunted down and sl aughtered all pagliaio \\nthieves. It was inevitable that some innocen ts suffered. It was possible that if Michael \\nwandered past a pagliaio that  had just been looted he mi ght be adjudged the criminal \\nunless he had somebody to vouch for him. \\nSo on one sunny morning he started hiking across the fields followed by his two faithful \\nshepherds. One of them was a plain simple fellow, almost moronic, silent as the dead \\nand with a face as impassive as  an Indian. He ha d the wiry small buil d of the typical \\nSicilian before they ran to the fat of middle age. His name was Calo. \\nThe other shepherd was more ou tgoing, younger, and had seen something of the world. \\nMostly oceans, since he had been a sailor in t he Italian navy during the war and had just \\nhad time enough to get himself tattooed before his ship was sunk and he was captured \\nby the British. But the tattoo made him a famous  man in his village. Sicilians do not often \\nlet themselves be tattooed, they do not have the opportunity nor the inclination. (The \\nshepherd, Fabrizzio, had done so primarily to cover a splotchy red birthmark on his \\nbelly.) And yet the Mafia market carts had ga ily painted scenes on th eir sides, beautifully \\nprimitive paintings done with loving care. In  any case, Fabrizzio, back is his native \\nvillage, was not too proud of t hat tattoo on his chest, though it showed a subject dear to \\nthe Sicilian “honor,” a husband stabbing a na ked man and woman ent wined together on \\nthe hairy floor of his belly. Fabrizzio would joke with Mi chael and ask questions about \\nAmerica, for of course it was impossibl e to keep them in the dark about his true \\nnationality. Still, they did not know exactly who he was except that he was in hiding and \\nthere could be no babbling ab out him. Fabrizzio sometimes brought Michael a fresh \\ncheese still sweating the milk that formed it. \\nThey walked along dusty country roads passi ng donkeys pulling gaily painted carts. The \\nland was filled with pink flowers, orange orchar ds, groves of almond and olive trees, all \\nblooming. That had been one of the surprises. Michael had expected a barren land \\nbecause of the legendar y poverty of Sicilians. And yet he had found it a land of gushing \\nplenty, carpeted with flowers scented by lem on blossoms. It was so beautiful that he \\nwondered how its people could bear to leave it. How terrible man had been to his fellow \\nman could be measured by the great exodus from what seemed to be a Garden of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 279\\nEden. \\nHe had planned to walk to t he coastal village of Mazara, and then take a bus back to \\nCorleone in the evening, and so tire hims elf out and be able to sleep. The two \\nshepherds wore rucksacks filled with bread and cheese they coul d eat on the way. They \\ncarried their luparas quite openly as  if out for a day’s hunting. \\nIt was a most beautiful morning. Michael fe lt as he had felt when as a child he had gone \\nout early on a summer day to play ball. Th en each day had been freshly washed, freshly \\npainted. And so it was now. Sicily was car peted is gaudy flowers,  the scent of orange \\nand lemon blossoms so heavy that even with his facial injury which pressed on the \\nsinuses, he could smell it. \\nThe smashing on the left site of his face had completely healed but the bone had formed \\nimproperly and the pressure on his sinuses made his left eye hurt. It also made his nose \\nrun continually, he filled up ha ndkerchiefs with mucus and o ften blew his nose out onto \\nthe ground as the local peasants did, a habit that had disgus ted him when he was a boy \\nand had seen old Italians, disdaining handkerchi efs as English foppery, blow out their \\nnoses in the asphalt gutters. \\nHis face too felt “heavy.” Dr. Taza had told him that this was due to the pressure on his \\nsinuses caused by the badly healed fracture. Dr . Taza called it an eggshell fracture of \\nthe zygoma; that if it had been treated before the bones kn itted, it could have been \\neasily remedied by a minor surgical procedure  using an instrument like a spoon to push \\nout the bone to its proper shape. Now, ho wever, said the dootor, he would have to \\ncheck into a Palermo hospital and undergo a major procedure called maxillo-facial \\nsurgery where the bone would be broken again. That was enough for Michael. He \\nrefused. And yet more than the pain, more than the nose dripping, he was bothered by \\nthe feeling of heaviness in his face. \\nHe never reached the coast that day. After going about fifteen miles he and his \\nshepherds stopped in the cool green watery shade of an orange grove to eat lunch and \\ndrink their wine. Fabrizzio was chattering about  how he would someday get to America. \\nAfter drinking and eating they lolled in the shade and Fabri zzio unbuttoned his shirt and \\ncontracted his stomach muscles to make the tattoo come alive. The naked couple on his \\nchest writhed in a lover’s agony and the dagger thrust by the husband quivered in their \\ntransfixed flesh. It amused them. It was while this was going on that Michael was hit with \\nwhat the Sicilians call “the thunderbolt.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 280\\nBeyond the orange grove lay the green ribboned fi elds of a baronial estate. Down the \\nroad from the grove was a villa so Roman it  looked as if it had been dug up from the \\nruins of Pompeii. It was a little palace with a huge marble portico and fluted Grecian \\ncolumns and through those columns came a bevy of village girls flanked by two stout \\nmatrons clad in black. They were from the village and had obviously fulfilled their \\nancient duty to the local baron by cleaning his villa and ot herwise preparing it for his \\nwinter sojourn. Now they were going into th e fields to pick the flowers with which they \\nwould fill the rooms. They were gathering the pink sulla, pu rple wisteria, mixing them \\nwith orange and lemon blossoms. The girls, not  seeing the men rest ing in the orange \\ngrove, came closer and closer. \\nThey were dressed in cheap gaily printed frocks that clung  to their bodies. They were \\nstill in their teens but with the full womanliness sun-drenched flesh ripened into so \\nquickly. Three or four of t hem started chasing one girl, chasing her toward the grove. \\nThe girl being chased held a bunch of huge purple grapes in  her left hand and with her \\nright hand was picking grapes off the cluste r and throwing them at her pursuers. She \\nhad a crown of ringleted hair as purple-blac k as the grapes and her body seemed to be \\nbursting out of its skin. \\nJust short of the grove she poi sed, startled, her eyes having caught the alien color of the \\nmen’s shirts. She stood there up on her toes poised like a deer to run. She was very close now, close enough for the men to  see every feature of her face. \\nShe was all ovals– oval-shaped eyes, the bones of her face , the contour of her brow. \\nHer skin was an exquisite dark creaminess and her eyes, enormous, dark violet or brown but dark with long heavy la shes shadowed her lovely face. Her mouth was rich \\nwithout being gross, sweet wit hout being weak and dyed dark red with the juice of the \\ngrapes. She was so incredibly lo vely that Fabrizzio murmured,  “Jesus Christ, take my \\nsoul, I’m dying,” as a joke, but the words came out a little too hoarsely. As if she had \\nheard him, the girl came down off her toes and whirled away from them and. fled back to \\nher pursuers. Her haunches moved like an animal’ s beneath the tight print of her dress; \\nas pagan and as innocently lustful. When s he reached her friends she whirled around \\nagain and her face was like a dark hollow aga inst the field of bright flowers. She \\nextended an arm, the hand full of grapes poi nted toward the grove. The girls fled \\nlaughing, with the black-clad, stout matrons scolding them on. \\nAs for Michael Corleone, he found himself standing, his heart pounding in his chest; he \\nfelt a little dizzy. The blood wa s surging through his body, th rough all its extremities and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 281\\npounding against the tips of his fingers, the ti ps of his toes. All the perfumes of the \\nisland came rushing in on the wind, orange, lemon blossoms, grapes, flowers. It seemed \\nas if his body had sprung away from him out of himself. And then he heard the two \\nshepherds laughing. \\n“You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?” Fabrizzi o said, clapping him on the shoulder. Even \\nCalo became friendly, patting him on the arm and saying, “Easy, man, easy,” but with \\naffection. As if Michael had been hit by a car. Fabrizzio handed him a wine bottle and \\nMichael took a long slug. It cleared his head. \\n“What the hell are you damn sheep lovers talking about?” he said. \\nBoth men laughed. Calo, his honest face fille d with the utmost seriousness, said, “You \\ncan’t hide the thunderbolt. When it hits you, ev erybody can see it. Christ, man, don’t be \\nashamed of it, some men pray for t he thunderbolt. You’re a lucky fellow.” \\nMichael wasn’t too pleased about his emotions  being so easily r ead. But this was the \\nfirst time in his life such a thing had happ ened to him. It was nothing like his adolescent \\ncrushes, it was nothing like the love he’d had for Kay, a love based as much on her \\nsweetness, her intelligence and the polar ity of the fair and dark. This was an \\noverwhelming desire for possession, this was an unerasable printing of the girl’s face on \\nhis brain and he knew she would haunt his memory every day of his life if he did not \\npossess her. His life had becom e simplified, focused on one point, everything else was \\nunworthy of even a moment’s attention. Du ring his exile he had alwa ys thought of Kay, \\nthough he felt they could never again be lovers or even friends. He was, after all was \\nsaid, a murderer, a Mafioso who had “made his bones.” But now Kay was wiped \\ncompletely out of his consciousness. \\nFabrizzio said briskly, “I’ll go to the village,  we’ll find out about her . Who knows, she may \\nbe more available than we think. There’s only one cure for the t hunderbolt, eh, Calo?” \\nThe other shepherd nodded his head gravely. Michael didn’t say anything. He followed \\nthe two shepherds as they started down tie road to the nearby village into which the \\nflock of girls had disappeared. \\nThe village was grouped around the usual central square wit h its fountain. But it was on \\na main route so there were some stores, wi ne shops and one little cafe with three tables \\nout on a small terrace. The shepherds sat at one of the tables and Michael joined them. \\nThere was no sign of the girls, not a trace.  The village seemed deser ted except for small \\nboys and a meandering donkey.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 282\\nThe proprietor of the cafe came to serve them. He was a short, burly man, almost \\ndwarfish but he greeted them cheerfully and set a dish of chickpeas at their table. \\n“You’re strangers here,” he said, “so let me advise you. Try my win e. The grapes come \\nfrom my own farm and it’s made by my sons themselves. They mix it with oranges and \\nlemons. It’s the best wine in Italy.” \\nThey let him bring the wine in a jug and it was even better than he claimed, dark purple \\nand as powerful as a brandy. Fabrizzo said to the cafe proprietor, “You know all the girls \\nhere, I’ll bet. We saw some beauties comi ng down the road, one in  particular got our \\nfriend here hit with the thunderbolt.” He motioned to Michael. \\nThe cafe owner looked at Michael with ne w interest. The cracked face had seemed \\nquite ordinary to him before, not worth a second glance. But a man hit with the thunderbolt was another matter. “You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my \\nfriend,” he said. “You’ll need help in getting to sleep tonight.” \\nMichael asked the man, “Do you know a girl  with her hair all curly? Very creamy skin, \\nvery big eyes, very dark eyes. Do you know a girl like that in the village?” \\nThe cafe owner said curdy, “N o. I don’t know any girl like t hat.” He vanished from the \\nterrace into his cafe. \\nThe three men drank their wine slowly, finished off the jug and called for more. The owner did not reappear. Fabrizzi o went into the cafe after him. When Fabrizzio came out \\nhe grimaced and said to Michael, “Just as I thought, it’s his daughter we were talking \\nabout and now he’s in the bac k boiling up his blood to do us a mischief. I think we’d \\nbetter start walking toward Corleone.” \\nDespite his months on the island Michael still could not get used to the Sicilian \\ntouchiness on matters of sex, and this was extreme even for a Sicilian. But the two \\nshepherds seemed to take it as a matter of c ourse. They were waiting for him to leave. \\nFabrizzio said, “The old bastard mentioned he has two sons, big tough lads that he has \\nonly to whistle up. Let’s get going.” \\nMichael gave him a cold stare. Up to now he had been a quiet, gentle young man, a \\ntypical American, except t hat since he was hiding in Sicily he must have done \\nsomething manly. This was the first time the shepherd s had seen the Corleone stare. \\nDon Tommasino, knowing Michael’s true i dentity and deed, had always been wary of \\nhim, treating him as a fellow “man of res pect.” But these unsophis ticated sheep herders \\nhad come to their own opinion of Michael, and not a wise one . The cold look, Michael’s  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 283\\nrigid white face, his anger that  came off him like cold smoke off ice, sobered their \\nlaughter and snuffed out their familiar friendliness. \\nWhen he saw he had their proper, respectful att ention Michael said to them, “Get that \\nman out here to me.” \\nThey didn’t hesitate. They shouldered their luparas and w ent into the dark coolness of \\nthe cafe. A few seconds later they reappeared with the cafe owne r between them. The \\nstubby man looked in no way frightened but hi s anger had a certain wariness about it. \\nMichael leaned back in his chair and studied the man for a moment. Then he said very \\nquietly, “I understand I’ve offended you by ta lking about your daughter. I offer you my \\napologies, I’m a stranger in this country, i don’t know the customs that well. Let me say \\nthis. I meant no disrespect to you or her.” \\nThe shepherd bodyguards were impressed. Mi chael’s voice had never sounded like this \\nbefore when speaking to them. There was command and authority in it though he was \\nmaking an apology. The cafe owner shrugged, more wary still, knowing he was not \\ndealing with some farmboy. “Who are you and what do you want from my daughter?” \\nWithout even hesitating Michael said, “I am an American hiding in Sicily, from the police of my country. My name is Michael. You can inform the police and make your fortune \\nbut then your daughter would lo se a father rather than gain a husband. In any case I \\nwant to meet your daughter. With your permission and under the s upervision of your \\nfamily. With all decorum. With all respect. I’m an honorable man and I don’t think of dishonoring your daughter. I want to meet her, talk to her and then if it hits us both right \\nwe’ll marry. If not, you’ll never see me agai n. She may find me unsympathetic after all, \\nand no man can remedy that. But when the pr oper time comes I’ll tell you everything \\nabout me that a wife’s father should know.” \\nAll three men were looking at him with amazem ent. Fabrizzio whispered in awe, “It’s the \\nreal thunderbolt.” The cafe owner, for the first time, didn’t look so confident, or \\ncontemptuous; his anger was not so sure. Fi nally he asked, “Are you a friend of the \\nfriends?” \\nSince the word Mafia could never be uttered aloud by the ordinary Sicilian, this was as \\nclose as the cafe owner could come to asking if Michael was a member of the Mafia. It \\nwas the usual way of asking if someone bel onged but it was ordinarily not addressed to \\nthe person directly concerned. \\n“No,” Michael said. “I’m a stranger in this country.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 284\\nThe cafe owner gave him anothe r look, the smashed left side of  his face, the long legs \\nrare in Sicily. He took a look at the two shepherds carryi ng their luparas quite openly \\nwithout fear and remembered how they had co me into his cafe and told him their \\npadrone wanted to talk to him. The cafe ow ner had snarled that he wanted the son of a \\nbitch out of his terrace and one of the shep herds had said, “Take my word, it’s best you \\ngo out and speak to him yourself.” A nd something had made him come out. Now \\nsomething made him realize that it would be best to show this stranger some courtesy. \\nHe said grudgingly, “Come Sunday afternoon. My name is Vitelli and my house is up \\nthere on the hill, above the village. But come here to the cafe and I’ll take you up.” \\nFabrizzio started to say something but Michael gave him one look and the shepherd’s \\ntongue froze in his mouth. This  was not lost on Vitelli. So  when Michael stood up and \\nstretched out his hand, the cafe owner took  it and smiled. He would make some \\ninquiries and if the answers were wrong he could always greet  Michael with his two sons \\nbearing their own shotguns. The cafe owner was not without his contacts among the \\n“friends of the friends.” But something told him this was one of those wild strokes of \\ngood fortune that Sicilians alwa ys believed in, something told him that his daughter’s \\nbeauty would make her fortune and her family secu re. And it was just as well. Some of \\nthe local youths were already beginning to buzz around and this  stranger with his \\nbroken face could do the necessary job of scar ing them off. Vitelli, to show his goodwill, \\nsent the strangers off with a bottle of his bes t and coldest wine. He noticed that one of \\nthe shepherds paid the bill. Th is impressed him even more, made it clear that Michael \\nwas the superior of the two men who accompanied him. \\nMichael was no longer interested in his hike . They found a garage  and hired a car and \\ndriver to take them back to Corleone, and some time before supper, Dr. Taza must have \\nbeen informed by the shepherds of what had happen. That evening, sitting in the \\ngarden, Dr. Taza said to Don Tommasino, “O ur friend got hit by the thunderbolt today.” \\nDon Tommasino did not seem surprised. He grunted. “I wish some of those young \\nfellows in Palermo would get a thunderbolt, maybe I could get some peace.” He was \\ntalking about the new-style Mafia chiefs rising in the big citi es of Palermo and \\nchallenging the power  of old-regime stalwarts like himself. \\nMichael said to Tommasino, “I want you to tell those two sheep herders to leave me \\nalone Sunday. I’m going to go to this gir l’s family for dinner and I don’t want them \\nhanging around.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 285\\nDon Tommasino shook his head. “I’m responsibl e to your father for you, don’t ask me \\nthat. Another thing, I hear you’ve even talked marriage. I can’t allow that until I’ve sent \\nsomebody to speak to your father.” \\nMichael Corleone was very careful, this  was after all a man of respect. “Don \\nTommasino, you know my father. He’s a m an who goes deaf when somebody says the \\nword no to him. And he doesn’ t get his hearing back until they answer him with a yes. \\nWell, he has heard my no many times. I u nderstand about the two guards, I don’t want \\nto cause you trouble, they can come with me Sunday, but if I want to marry I’ll marry. \\nSurely if I don’t permit my own father to in terfere with my personal  life it would be an \\ninsult to him to allow you to do so.” \\nThe capo-mafioso sighed. “Well, then, ma rriage it will have to be. I know your \\nthunderbolt. She’s a good girl from a respec table family. You can’t dishonor them \\nwithout the father trying to k ill you, and then you’ll have to shed blood. Besides, I know \\nthe family well, I can’t allow it to happen.” \\nMichael said, “She may not be able to stand t he sight of me, and she’s a very young girl, \\nshe’ll think me old.” He saw the two m en smiling at him. “I’ll need some money for \\npresents and I think I’ll need a car.” \\nThe Don nodded. “Fabrizzio will take care of everything, he’s a clever boy, they taught \\nhim mechanics in the navy. I’ll give you some money in the morning and I’ll let your \\nfather know what’s happening. That I must do.” \\nMichael said to Dr. Taza, “Have you got anything that can dry up this damn snot always \\ncoming out of my nose? I can’t have that girl seeing me wiping it all the time.” \\nDr. Taza said, “I’ll coat it with a drug before you have to see her. It makes your flesh a little numb but, don’t worry, you won’t be kissing her for a wh ile yet.” Both doctor and \\nDon smiled at this witticism. \\nBy Sunday, Michael had an Alfa Romeo, battered but serviceable. He had also made a bus trip to Palermo to buy presents for t he girl and her family. He had learned that the \\ngirl’s name was Apollonia and every night he thought of her lovely face and her lovely name. He had to drink a good d eal of wine to get some sl eep and orders were given to \\nthe old women servants in the h ouse to leave a chilled bottle at his bedside. He drank.it \\nempty every night. \\nOn Sunday, to the tolling of church bells that covered all of Sicily, he drove the Alfa \\nRomeo to the village and parked it just outside the cafe. Calo and Fabrizzio were in the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 286\\nback seat with their lupar as and Michael told them they we re to wait in the cafe, they \\nwere not to come to the house. The cafe wa s closed but Vitelli was there waiting for \\nthem, leaning against the railing of his empty terrace. \\nThey shook hands all around and Michael took the three packages, the presents, and \\ntrudged up the hill with Vitelli to his home. This proved to be la rger than the usual village \\nhut, the Vitellis were not poverty-stricken. \\nInside the house was familiar wit h statues of the Madonna en tombed in glass, votive \\nlights flickering redly at their feet. The two sons were waiting, also dressed in their \\nSunday black. They were two sturdy young m en just out of their teens but liking older \\nbecause of their hard work on the farm. The mo ther was a vigorous woman, as stout as \\nher husband. There was no sign of the girl. \\n \\nAfter the introductions, which Michael did not even hear, they sat in the room that might \\npossibly have been a living room or just as easily the formal dining room. It was \\ncluttered with all kinds of furn iture and not very large but for Sicily it was middle-class \\nsplendor. \\nMichael gave Signor Vitelli and Si gnora Vitelli their presents. Fo r the father it was a gold \\ncigar-cutter, for the mother a bolt of the fi nest cloth purchasable in Palermo. He still had \\none package for the girl. His presents were received with reserved thanks. The gifts \\nwere a little too premature, he should not  have given anything until his second visit. \\nThe father said to him, in man-to-man co untry fashion, “Don’t think we’re so of no \\naccount to welcome strangers into our h ouse so easily. But Don Tommasino vouched \\nfor you personally and nobody in this province  would ever doubt the word of that good \\nman. And so we make you welcome. But I mu st tell you that if your intentions are \\nserious about my daughter, we wil l have to know a little more  about you and your family. \\nYou can understand, your family  is from this country.” \\nMichael nodded and said politely, “I will tell you anything you wish to know anytime.” \\nSignor Vitelli held up a hand. “I’m  not a nosy man. Let’s see if it’s necessary first. Right \\nnow you’re welcome in my house as a friend of Don Tommasino.” \\nDespite the drug painted inside his nose, Michael  actually smelled t he girl’s presence in \\nthe room. He turned and she was standing in t he arched doorway that led to the back of \\nthe house. The smell was of fr esh flowers and lemon blossoms  but she wore nothing in  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 287\\nher hair of jet black curls, nothing on her plain severe black dress, obviously her Sunday \\nbest. She gave him a quick glance and a tiny smile before she cast her eyes down \\ndemurely and sat down next to her mother. \\nAgain Michael felt that shor tness of breath, that flooding  through his body of something \\nthat was not so much desire as an insane  possessiveness. He u nderstood for the first \\ntime the classical jealousy of the Italian male . He was at that moment ready to kill \\nanyone who touched this girl, who tried to claim her, take her away from him. He wanted \\nto own her as wildly as a miser wants to own gold coins, as hungrily as a sharecropper \\nwants to own his own land. Nothing was goi ng to stop him from owning this girl, \\npossessing her, locking her in a house and k eeping her prisoner only for himself. He \\ndidn’t want anyone even to see her. When she turned to smile at one of her brothers \\nMichael gave that young man a murderous look  without even realizing it. The family \\ncould see it was a classical case of the “thunderbolt” and they were reassured. This \\nyoung man would be putty in their daughter’s hands until they were married. After that of \\ncourse things would change but it wouldn’t matter. \\nMichael had bought himself some new clot hes in Palermo and was no longer the \\nroughly dressed peasant, and it was obvious to the family that he was a Don of some \\nkind. His smashed face did not make him as evil-looking as he believed; because his other profile was so handsome it made the disfigur ement interesting even. And in any \\ncase this was a land where to be called disfigured you had to compete with a host of \\nmen who had suffered extreme physical misfortune. \\nMichael looked directly at the girl, the lovely  ovals of her face. Her lips now he could see \\nwere almost blue so dark was the blood pulsating in  them. He said, not daring to speak \\nher name, “I saw you by the orange groves the other day. When you ran away. I hope I \\ndidn’t frighten you?” \\nThe girl raised her eyes to him for just a fraction. She shook her head. But the loveliness of those eyes had made Michael look away. The mother said tartly, “Apollonia, speak to \\nthe poor fellow, he’s come miles to see you, ” but the girl’s long jet lashes remained \\nclosed like wings over her eyes. Michael handed her the present wrapped in gold paper \\nand the girl put it in her lap. The father sa id, “Open it, girl,” but her hands did not move. \\nHer hands were small and brown, an urchin ’s hands. The mother  reached over and \\nopened the package impatiently, yet careful not  to tear the precious paper. The red \\nvelvet jeweler’s box gave her pause, she had never held such a thing in her hands and \\ndidn’t know how to spring its catch. But s he got it open on pure instinct and then took  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 288\\nout the present. \\nIt was a heavy gold chain to be worn as a necklace, and it awed them not only because \\nof its obvious value but because a gift of gold in this society was also a statement of the \\nmost serious intentions. It was no less than a proposal of matrimony, or rather the signal \\nthat there was the intention to propose matrimony. They could no longer doubt the \\nseriousness of this stranger. And they could not doubt his substance. \\nApollonia still had not touched her  present. Her mother held it up for her to see and she \\nraised those long lashes for a moment and then she looked directly at Michael, her \\ndoelike brown eyes grave, and said, “Grazie. ” It was the first time he had heard her \\nvoice. \\nIt had all the velvety softness of youth and shy ness and it set Michael’s ears ringing. He \\nkept looking away from her and talking to the father and mother simply because looking \\nat her confused him so much. But he noticed t hat despite the conservative looseness of \\nher dress her body almost shone through the cl oth with sheer sensuality. And he noticed \\nthe darkening of her skin blushing, the dar k creamy skin, going da rker with the blood \\nsurging to her feet. \\nFinally Michael rose to go and the family ro se too. They said their good-byes formally, \\nthe girl at last confronting him as they sh ook hands, and he felt the shock of her skin on \\nhis skin, her skin warm and rough, peasant skin.  The father walked down the hill with \\nhim to his car and invited him to Sunday di nner the next week. Michael nodded but he \\nknew he couldn’t wait a week to see the girl again. \\nHe didn’t. The next day, without his shepherd s, he drove to the village and sat on the \\ngarden terrace of the cafe to ch at with her father. Si gnor Vitelli took pity on him and sent \\nfor his wife and daughter to come down to the ca fe to join them. This meeting was less \\nawkward. The girl Apolloni a was less shy, and spoke more . She was dressed in her \\neveryday print frock which suit ed her coloring much better. \\nThe next day the same thing happened. Only this time Apollonia was wearing the gold \\nchain he had given her. He smil ed at her then, knowing that th is was a signal to him. He \\nwalked with her up the hill, her mother close behind them. But it was impossible for the \\ntwo young people to keep their bodies fr om brushing against each other and once \\nApollonia stumbled and fell agai nst him so that he had to hold her and her body so \\nwarm and alive in his hands started a deep wave of blood rising  in his body. They could \\nnot see the mother behind t hem smiling because her daughter was a mountain goat and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 289\\nhad not stumbled on this path since she was an infant in diapers. And smiling because \\nthis was the only way this young man was going to get his hands on her daughter until \\nthe marriage. \\nThis went on for two weeks. Michael brou ght her presents every time he came and \\ngradually she became less shy. But they could never meet without a chaperone being \\npresent. She was just a village girl, barely li terate, with no idea of the world, but she had \\na freshness, an eagerness for life that, with help of the language barrier, made her seem \\ninteresting. Everything went very swiftly at Michael’s request. And because the girl was \\nnot only fascinated by him but knew he must  be rich, a wedding date was set for the \\nSunday two weeks away. \\nNow Don Tommasino took a hand. He had rece ived word from America that Michael \\nwas not subject to orders but that all elem entary precautions shoul d be taken. So Don \\nTommasino appointed himself the parent of the br idegroom to insure the presence of his \\nown bodyguards. Calo and Fabrizzio were al so members of the wedding party from \\nCorieone as was Dr. Taza. The bride and gr oom would live in Dr. Taza’s villa \\nsurrounded by its stone wall. \\nThe wedding was the usual pea sant one. The villagers st ood in the streets and threw \\nflowers as the bridal party, principals and guests, went on fo ot from the church to the \\nbride’s home. The wedding pr ocession pelted the neighbors wi th sugar-coated almonds, \\nthe traditional weddin g candies, and with candies left ov er made sugary white mountain \\non the bride’s wedd ing bed, in this case only a symbo lic one since the first night would \\nbe spent in the villa outside Corleone. The wedding feas t went on until midnight but \\nbride and groom would leave before that in the Alfa Romeo. When that time came \\nMichael was surprised to find that the mot her was coming with them to the Corleone \\nvilla at the request of the bride. The father explained: t he girl was young, a virgin, a little \\nfrightened, she would need someone to talk to on the morning following her bridal night; \\nto put her on the right track if things w ent wrong. These matters could sometimes get \\nvery tricky. Michael saw Apollonia looki ng at him with doubt in her huge doe-brown \\neyes. He smiled at her and nodded. \\nAnd so it came about that  they drove back to the v illa outside Corleone with the \\nmother-in-law in the car. But the older woman immediately put her head together with \\nthe servants of Dr. Taza, gave her daughter a hug and a kiss and di sappeared from the \\nscene. Michael and his bride were allowed to go to their huge bedroom alone.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 290\\nApollonia was still wearing her bridal costume with a cloak th rown over it. Her trunk and \\ncase had been brought up to the room from the car. On a small table was a bottle of \\nwine and a plate of small w edding cakes. The hu ge canopied bed was never out of their \\nvision. The young girl in the center of the room waited fo r Michael to make the first \\nmove. \\nAnd now that he had her alone, now that he legally possesse d her, now that there was \\nno barrier to his enjoying that body and fa ce he had dreamed about every night, Michael \\ncould not bring himself to approach her. He watched as she took off the bridal shawl and \\ndraped it over a chair, and plac ed the bridal crown on the sm all dressing table. That \\ntable had an array of perfumes and creams t hat Michael had had sent from Palermo. \\nThe girl tallied them wit h her eyes for a moment. \\nMichael turned off the lights, thinking the girl  was waiting for some darkness to shield \\nher body while she undressed. But the Sici lian moon came through the unshuttered \\nwindows, bright as gold, and Michael went to close the shutters but not all the way, the room would be too warm. \\nThe girl was still standing by the table and so  Michael went out of the room and down \\nthe hall to the bathroom. He and Dr. Taza and Don Tommasino had taken a glass of \\nwine together in the garden while the wom en had prepared themselves for bed. He had \\nexpected to find Apollonia in her nightgo wn when he returned, already between the \\ncovers. He was surprised that the mother had not done this service for her daughter. \\nMaybe Apollonia had wanted him to help her to undress. But he was certain she was too \\nshy, too innocent for such forward behavior. \\nComing back into the bedroom, he found it co mpletely dark, someone had closed the \\nshutters all the way. He groped his way to ward the bed and could make out the shape of \\nApollonia’s body lying under the covers, her back to him, her body curved away from \\nhim and huddled up. He undressed and slipped naked beneath the sheets. He stretched \\nout one hand and touched silky naked skin. She had not put on her gown and this \\nboldness delighted him. Slowly, carefully, he put one hand on her shoulder and pressed \\nher body gently so that she would turn to  him. She turned slo wly and his hand touched \\nher breast, soft, full and then she was in his arms so quickiy that their bodies came together in one line of silk en electricity and he finally had his arms around her, was \\nkissing her warm mouth deeply, was crushing her body and breasts against him and then rolling his body on top of hers.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 291\\nHer flesh and hair taut silk, now she was all eagerness, surging against him wildly in a \\nvirginal erotic frenzy. When he entered her she gave a little gasp and was still for just a \\nsecond and then in a powerful forward thrust of her pelvis she locked her satiny legs \\naround his hips. When they came to the end they were locked together so fiercely, \\nstraining against each other so violently, t hat falling away from each other was like the \\ntremble before death. \\nThat night and the weeks that followed, Michael Corleone came to understand the \\npremium put on virginity by soci ally primitive people. It was a period of sensuality that he \\nhad never before experienced, a sensuality mi xed with a feeling of masculine power. \\nApollonia in those first days became almost his slave. Given trust, given affection, a \\nyoung full-blooded girl aroused fr om virginity to erotic awar eness was as delicious as an \\nexactly ripe fruit. \\nShe on her part brightened up the rather gloom y masculine atmosphere of the villa. She \\nhad packed her mother off the very next day after her bridal night and presided at the communal table with bright girlish charm.  Don Tommasino dined with them every night \\nand Dr. Taza told all his old stories as they  drank wine in the ga rden full of statues \\ngarlanded with blood-red flower s, and so the evenings pa ssed pleasantly enough. At \\nnight in their bedroom the new ly married couple spent hours of feverish lovemaking. \\nMichael could not get eno ugh of Apollonia’s beautiful ly sculpted body, her \\nhoney-colored skin, her huge brown eyes gl owing with passion. She had a wonderfully \\nfresh smell, a fleshly smell perfumed by  her sex yet almost sweet and unbearably \\naphrodisiacal. Her virginal passion matched his nuptial lust and often it was dawn when \\nthey fell into an exhausted slumber. Sometimes, spent but not yet ready for sleep, \\nMichael sat on the window ledge and stared at Apollonia’s naked body while she slept. Her face too was lovely in repose, a perfect  face he had seen before only in art books of \\npainted Italian Madonnas who by no stretch of t he artist’s skill could be thought virginal. \\nIn the first week of their marriage they went on picnics and small trips in the Alfa Romeo. \\nBut then Don Tommasino took Michael aside and explained that the marriage had made \\nhis presence and identity common knowledge in that part of Sicily and precautions had \\nto be taken against the enemies of the Co rleone Family, whose long arms also \\nstretched to this island refuge. Don Tomm asino put armed guards around his villa and \\nthe two shepherds, Calo and Fabrizzio, were fi xtures inside the walls. So Michael and \\nhis wife had to remain on the villa grounds. Michael pa ssed the time by teaching \\nApollonia to read and write English and to drive the car along the inner walls of the villa.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 292\\nAbout this time Don Tommasino seemed to be preoccupied and poor company. He was \\nstill having trouble with the new Mafia in the town of Palermo, Dr. Taza said. \\nOne night in the garden an old village woman who worked in the house as a servant \\nbrought a dish of fresh olives and then tur ned to Michael and said, “Is it true what \\neverybody is saying that you are the son of Don Corleone in Ne w York City, the \\nGodfather?” \\nMichael saw Don Tommasino shaking his head in  disgust at the general knowledge of \\ntheir secret. But the old crone was looking at hi m in so concerned a fashion, as if it was \\nimportant for her to know the truth, that Michael nodded. “Do you know  my father?” he \\nasked. \\nThe woman’s name was Filomena and her face was as wrinkled and brown as a walnut, \\nher brown-stained teeth showing through the shel l of her flesh. For the first time since \\nhe had been in the villa she smiled at him. “The Godfather saved my life once,” she \\nsaid, “and my brains too.” She made a gesture toward her head. \\nShe obviously wanted to say something else  so Michael smiled to encourage her. She \\nasked almost fearfully, “Is it  true that Luca Brasi is dead?” \\nMichael nodded again and was surprised at the look of release on the old woman’s face. \\nFilomena crossed herself and said, “God forgiv e me, but may his soul roast in hell for \\neternity.” \\nMichael remembered his old curiosity about Br asi, and had the sudden in tuition that this \\nwoman knew the story Hagen and Sonny had refused to te ll him. He poured the woman \\na glass of wine and made her si t down. “Tell me about my father and Luca Brasi,” he \\nsaid gently. “I know some of it, but how di d they become friends and why was Brasi so \\ndevoted to my father? Don’t be afraid, come tell me.” \\nFilomena’s wrinkled face, her raisin-black eyes, turned to Don Tommasino, who in some \\nway signaled his permission. And so Filomena passed the evening for them by telling \\nher story. \\nThirty years before, Filomena  had been a midwife in New York City, on Tenth Avenue, \\nservicing the Italian colony. The women we re always pregnant a nd she prospered. She \\ntaught doctors a few things when they tried to interfere in a difficult birth. Her husband was then a prosperous grocery store owner , dead now poor soul, she blessed him, \\nthough he had been a card play er and wencher who never t hought to put aside for hard \\ntimes. In any event one cursed night thirty  years ago when all hones t people were long  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 293\\nin their beds, there came a knocking on Filomena’s door. She was by no means \\nfrightened, it was the quiet hour  babes prudently chose to enter  safely into this sinful \\nworld, and so she dressed and opened t he door. Outside it was Luca Brasi whose \\nreputation even then wa s fearsome. It was known also that he was a bachelor. And so \\nFilomena was immediately frightened. She t hought he had come to do her husband \\nharm, that perhaps her hus band had foolishly refusal Brasi some small favor. \\nBut Brasi had come on the usual errand. He  told Filomena that there was a woman \\nabout to give birth, that the house was out  of the neighborhood some distance away and \\nthat she was to come with him. Filomena immediately sensed something amiss. Brasi’s \\nbrutal face looked almost like that of a m adman that night, he was obviously in the grip \\nof some demon. She tried to protest that  she attended only women whose history she \\nknew but he shoved a handful of green do llars in her hand and ordered her roughly to \\ncome along with him. She wa s too frightened to refuse. \\nIn the street was a Ford, its driver of the same feather as Luca Brasi. The drive was no more than thirty minutes to a small frame hous e in Long Island City ri ght over the bridge. \\nA two-family house but obviously now tenant ed only by Brasi and his gang. For there \\nwere some other ruffians in the kitchen playing cards and dr inking. Brasi took Filomena \\nup the stairs to a bedroom. In the bed was a y oung pretty girl who looked Irish, her face \\npainted, her hair red; and with a belly swollen like a sow.  The poor girl was so \\nfrightened. When she sa w Brasi she turned her  head away in terror, yes terror, and \\nindeed the look of hatred on Brasi’s evil fa ce was the most frightening thing she had \\never seen in her life. (Here Filomena crossed herself again.) \\nTo make a long story short, Brasi left the ro om. Two of his men assisted the midwife and \\nthe baby was born, the mother was exhaus ted and went into a deep sleep. Brasi was \\nsummoned and Filomena, who had wrapped the newborn child in an extra blanket, \\nextended the bundle to him and said, “If you’re the father, take her. My work is finished.” \\nBrasi glared at her, malevolent, insanity st amped on his face. “Yes, I’m the father,” he \\nsaid. “But I don’t want any of that race to live. Take it down to the basement and throw it \\ninto the furnace.” \\nFor a moment Filomena thought she had no t understood him properly. She was puzzled \\nby his use of the word “race.” Did he mean because the girl was not  Italian? Or did he \\nmean because the girl was obviously of the lo west type; a whore in short? Or did he \\nmean that anything springing from his loins he forbade to live. And then she was sure he  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 294\\nwas making a brutal joke. She said shortly, “It’s your child, do what you want.” And she \\ntried to hand him the bundle. \\nAt this time the exhausted mother awoke and turned on her side to face them. She was \\njust in time to see Brasi thrust violently  at the bundle, crushi ng the newborn infant \\nagainst Filomena’s chest. She called out weakly , “Luc, Luc, I’m sorry,” and Brasi turned \\nto face her. \\nIt was terrible, Filomena said now. So terribl e. They were like two mad animals. They \\nwere not human. The hatred they bore eac h other blazed through the room. Nothing \\nelse, not even the newborn infa nt, existed for them at that  moment. And yet there was a \\nstrange passion. A bloody, demoni cal lust so unnatural you knew they were damned \\nforever. Then Luca Brasi turned back to Filomena and said harshly, “Do what tell you, I’ll \\nmake you rich.” \\nFilomena could not speak in her terror. She shook her head. Finally she managed to \\nwhisper, “You do it, you’re the father, do it if  you like.” But Brasi di dn’t answer. Instead \\nhe drew a knife from inside his shir t. “I’ll cut your throat,” he said. \\nShe must have gone into shock then because the next thing she remembered they were \\nall standing in the basement of  the house in front of a s quare iron furnace. Filomena \\nwas still holding the blanket ed baby, which had not made a sound. (Maybe if it had \\ncried, maybe if I had been shre wd enough to pinch it, Filom ena said, that monster would \\nhave shown mercy.) \\nOne of the men must have open ed the furnace door, the fire now was visible. And then \\nshe was alone with Brasi in that  basement with its sweating pi pes, its mousy odor. Brasi \\nhad his knife out again. And there could be no doubting that he w ould kill her. There \\nwere the flames, there were Br asi’s eyes. His face was the ga rgoyle of the devil, it was \\nnot human, it was not sane: He pus hed her toward the open furnace door. \\nAt this point Filomena fell silent. She folded her bony hands in her lap and looked \\ndirectly at Michael. He knew  what she wanted, how she w anted to tell him, without using \\nher voice. He asked gently, “Did you do it?” She nodded. \\nIt was only after another glass of wine and cr ossing herself and muttering a prayer that \\nshe continued her story. She was given a bundle of money and driven home. She \\nunderstood that if she utter ed a word about what had happened she woul d be killed. But \\ntwo days later Brasi murdered the young Irish girl, the mother of the infant, and was \\narrested by the police. Filom ena, frightened out of her wits,  went to the Godfather and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 295\\ntold her story. He ordered her to keep silent, that he would a ttend to everything. At that \\ntime Brasi did not work for Don Corleone. \\nBefore Don Corleone could set matters aright, Luca Brasi tried to commit suicide in his \\ncell, hacking at his throat with a piece of gl ass. He was transferred to the prison hospital \\nand by the time he recovered Don Corleone had arranged everything. The police did not \\nhave a case they could prove in court and Luca Brasi was released. \\nThough Don Corleone assured Filomena that she had nothing to  fear from either Luca \\nBrasi or the police, she had no peace. Her nerves were shattered and she could no \\nlonger work at her professi on. Finally she persuaded her husband to sell the grocery \\nstore and they returned to Italy. Her husband wa s a good man, had been told everything \\nand understood. But he was a weak man and in Italy squandered the fortune they had \\nboth slaved in America to earn. And so after he died she had become a servant. So Filomena ended her story. She had another glass of wine and said to Michael, “I bless \\nthe name of your father. He always sent me money when I asked, he saved me from Brasi. Tell him I say a prayer for his soul ev ery night and that he shouldn’t fear dying.” \\nAfter she had left, Michael asked Don Tommasino, “Is her story true?” The \\ncapo-mafioso nodded. And Michael though t, no wonder nobody wanted to tell him the \\nstory. Some story. Some Luca. \\nThe next morning Michael wanted to discu ss the whole thug with Don Tommasino but \\nlearned that the old man had been called to Palermo by an urgent message delivered by \\na courier. That evening Don Tommasino retu rned and took Michael aside. News had \\ncome from America, he said. Ne ws that it grieved him to tell. Santino Corleone had been \\nkilled. \\nChapter 24 \\nThe Sicilian sun, early-morning lemon-color ed, filled Michael’s bed room. He awoke and, \\nfeeling Apollonia’s satiny body against hi s own sleep-warm skin, made her come awake \\nwith love. When they were done, even all the months of complete possession could not \\nstop him from marveling at her beauty and her passion. \\nShe left the bedroom to wash and dress in the bathroom down the hall. Michael, still \\nnaked, the morning sun refreshing his body, lit  a cigarette and relaxed on the bed. This \\nwas the last morning they would spend in this house and the villa. Don Tommasino had arranged for him to be transferred to another town on the southern coast of Sicily. \\nApollonia, in the first month of pregnancy, w anted to visit with her family for a few weeks  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 296\\nand would join him at the new hiding place after the visit. \\nThe night before, Don Tommasino had sat with Michael in  the garden after Apollonia \\nhad gone to bed. The Don had been worried and tired, and admitted that he was \\nconcerned about Michael’s safety. “Your ma rriage brought you into sight,” he told \\nMichael: “I’m surprised your father hasn’t made arrangements for you to go someplace \\nelse. In any case I’m having my own troubl es with the young Tur ks in Palermo. I’ve \\noffered some fair arrangements so that they can wet their beaks more than they \\ndeserve, but those scum want everything. I can’t understand t heir attitude. They’ve tried \\na few little tricks but I’m not so  easy to kill. They must know I’m too strong for them to \\nhold me so cheaply. But that’s the trouble with young people, no matter how talented. \\nThey don’t reason things out and they want all the water in the well.” \\nAnd then Don Tommasino had told Michael that the two shepherds, Fabrizzio and Calo, \\nwould go with him as bodyguards in the Al fa Romeo. Don Tommasino would say his \\ngood-byes tonight since he would be off early in  the morning, at dawn, to see to his \\naffairs in Palermo. Also, Michael was not to  tell Dr. Taza about the move, since the \\ndoctor planned to spend the evening in Palermo and might blab. \\nMichael had known Don Tommasi no was in trouble. Armed guar ds patrolled the walls of \\nthe villa at night and a few faithful shepherds with their luparas were always in the \\nhouse. Don Tommasino himself went heavily armed and a personal bodyguard attended \\nhim at all times. \\nThe morning sun was now too strong. Michae l stubbed out his cigarette and put on work \\npants, work shirt and the peaked cap most Sicilian men wore. Still barefooted, he leaned \\nout his bedroom window and saw Fabrizzio sitti ng in one of the garden chairs. Fabrizzio \\nwas lazily combing his thick dark hair, his lupara was ca relessly thrown acres the \\ngarden table. Michael whistled and Fabrizzio looked up to his window. \\n“Get the car,” Michael called down to him. “I’ ll be leaving in five minutes. Where’s Calo?” \\nFabrizzio stood up. His shirt was open, exposi ng the blue and red lines of the tattoo on \\nhis chest. “Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen,” F abrizzio said. “Is your wife \\ncoming with you?” \\nMichael squinted down at him. It occurr ed to him that Fabrizzio had been following \\nApollonia too much with his eyes the last few weeks. Not that he would dare ever to \\nmake an advance toward the wife of a friend of the Don’s. In Sicily there was no \\nsurerroad to death. Michael said coldly, “No, she’s going home to her family first, she’ll  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 297\\njoin us in a few days.” He watched Fabrizzio hurry into the stone hut that served as a \\ngarage for the Alfa Romeo. \\nMichael went down the hall to  wash. Apollonia was gone. Sh e was most likely in the \\nkitchen preparing his breakfast with her own hands to wash out the guilt she felt \\nbecause she wanted to see her family one more time before going so far away to the \\nother end of Sicily. Don Tommasino would arrange transportation for her to where \\nMichael would be. \\nDown in the kitchen the old woman Filom ena brought him his coffee and shyly bid him a \\ngood bye. ‘I’ll remember you to my fa ther,” Michael said and she nodded. \\nCalo came into the kitchen and said to Michael , “The car’s outside, shall I get your bag?” \\n“No, I’ll get it,” Michael  said. “Where’s Apolla?” \\nCalo’s face broke into an amused grin. “She’s sitting in the driver’s s eat of the car, dying \\nto step on the gas. She’ll be a real American  woman before she gets to America.” It was \\nunheard of for one of the peasant wo men in Sicily to attempt driving a car. But Michael \\nsometimes let Apollonia guide the Alfa Romeo around the inside of the villa walls, \\nalways beside her however because she sometimes stepped on the gas when she \\nmeant to step on the brake. \\nMichael said to Calo, “Get F abrizzio and wait for me in the car.” He went out of the \\nkitchen and ran up the stairs to the bedr oom. His bag was already packed. Before \\npicking it up he looked out  the window and saw the car par ked in front of the portico \\nsteps rather than the kitchen entrance. \\nApollonia was sitting in the car, her hands on the wheel like a child playing. Calo was \\njust putting the lunch basket in the rear seat. And then Michael was annoyed to see \\nFabrizzio disappearing through the gates of the villa on some errand outside. What the \\nhell was he doing? He saw Fabrizzio take a l ook over his shoulder, a look that was \\nsomehow furtive. He’d have to straighten that damn shepherd out. Michael went down \\nthe stairs and decided to go through the kitchen to see Filomena again and give her a final farewell. He asked the old wom an, “Is Dr. Taza still sleeping?” \\nFilomena’s wrinkled face was sly. “Old roosters can’t greet the sun.  The doctor went to \\nPalermo last night.” \\nMichael laughed. He went out the kitchen entranc e and the smell of lemon blossoms \\npenetrated even his sinus-filled nos e. He saw Apollonia wave to him from the car just  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 298\\nten paces up the villa’s driv eway and then he realized she was motioning him to stay \\nwhere he was, that she meant to drive the car to where he stood. Calo stood grinning \\nbeside the car, his lupara danglin g in his hand. But there was st ill no sign of Fabrizzio. \\nAt that moment; without any conscious reasoni ng process, everything came together in \\nhis mind, and Michael shouted to the girl, “N o! No!” But his shout was drowned in the \\nroar of the tremendous explos ion as Apollonia switched on the ignition. The kitchen door \\nshattered into fragments and Michael was hur led along the wall of the villa for a good \\nten feet. Stones tumbling from the villa roof hit him on the shoulders and one glanced off \\nhis skull as he was lying on the ground. He was conscious just long enough to see that \\nnothing remained of the Alfa Romeo but its f our wheels and the steel shafts which held \\nthem together. \\n* * *  \\nHe came to consciousness in a room that seemed very dark and heard voices that were \\nso low that they were pure sound rather than words. Out of  animal instinct he tried to \\npretend he was still un conscious but the voices stoppe d and someone was leaning from \\na chair close to his bed and the voice was di stinct now, saying, “Well, he’s with us \\nfinally.” A lamp went on, it s light like white fire on his eyeballs and Michael turned his \\nhead. It felt very heavy, numb. And then he coul d see the face over his bed was that of \\nDr. Taza. \\n“Let me look at you a minute and I’ll put the light out,” Dr,. Taza said gently. He was \\nbusy shining a small pencil flas hlight into Michael’s eyes. “You’ll be all right,” Dr. Taza \\nsaid and turned to someone else in the room. “You can speak to him.” \\nIt was Don Tommasino sitting on a chair near his bed, Michael could see him clearly \\nnow. Don Tommasino was saying, “Michael, Michael, can I talk to you? Do you want to \\nrest?” \\nIt was easier to raise a hand to make a ge sture and Michael did so  and Don Tommasino \\nsaid, “Did Fabrizzio bring the car from the garage?” \\nMichael, without knowing he did so, smiled. It was in some strange way, a chilling smile, \\nof assent. Don Tommasino said, “Fabrizzio has vanished. Listen to me, Michael. You’ve \\nbeen unconscious for nearly a week. Do you understand? Everybody thinks you’re dead, so you’re safe now, they’ve stopped looking for you. I’ve sent messages to your \\nfather and he’s sent back instructions. It won’ t be long now, you’ll be back in America. \\nMeanwhile you’ll rest here quietly. You’re safe up in the mountains, in a special  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 299\\nfarmhouse I own. The Palermo people have m ade their peace with me now that you’re \\nsupposed to be dead, so it was you they were after all the time. They wanted to kill you \\nwhile making people think it was me they were  after. That’s something you should know. \\nAs for everything else, leave it all to me . You recover your strength and be tranquil.” \\nMichael was remembering ever ything now. He knew his wif e was dead, that Calo was \\ndead. He thought of the old woman in the ki tchen. He couldn’t remember if she had \\ncome outside with him. He whispered, “Fil omena?” Don Tommasino said quietly, “She \\nwasn’t hurt, just a bloody nose from the blast. Don’t worry about her.” \\nMichael said, “Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio \\nwill own the finest pastures in Sicily.” \\nBoth men seemed to sigh with relief. Don Tontmasino lifted a glass from a nearby table \\nand drank from it an amber fl uid that jolted his head up. Dr. Taza sat on the bed and \\nsaid almost absently, “You know, you’re a widow er. That’s rare in Sicily.” As if the \\ndistinction might comfort him. \\nMichael motioned to Don Tommasino to lean closer. The Don sat on the bed and bent \\nhis head. “Tell my father to get me home,” Mi chael said. “Tell my father I wish to be his \\nson.” \\nBut it was to be another month before Michael recovered from his in juries and another \\ntwo months after that before all the nec essary papers and arrangements were ready. \\nThen he was flown from Palermo to Rome and fr om Rome to New York. In all that time \\nno trace had been found of Fabrizzio. \\nBook Seven  \\nChapter 25 \\nWhen Kay Adams received her college degree, s he took a job teachi ng grade school in \\nher New Hampshire hometown. The first six months after Michael vanished she made \\nweekly telephone calls to his mother a sking about him. Mrs. Corleone was always \\nfriendly and always wound up sayi ng, “You a very very nice girl. You forget about Mikey \\nand find a nice husband.” Kay was not offe nded at her bluntness and understood that \\nthe mother spoke out of conc ern for her as a young girl in an impossible situation. \\nWhen her first school term ended, she decided to go to New York to buy some decent \\nclothes and see some old college girl friends. She thought also about looking for some \\nsort of interesting job in New York. She had lived like a spinster for almost two years,  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 300\\nreading and teaching, refusing dates, refusi ng to go out at all, even though she had \\ngiven up making calls to Long Beach. She k new she couldn’t k eep that up, she was \\nbecoming irritable and unhappy. But she had always believed Mi chael would write her or \\nsend her a message of some sort. That he had not done so humilia ted her, it saddened \\nher that he was so distrustful even of her. \\nShe took an early train and was checked into her hotel by midafternoon. Her girl friends \\nworked and she didn’t want to bother them at their jobs, s he planned to call them at \\nnight. And she didn’t really feel like going shopping after the exhausting train trip. Being \\nalone in the hotel room, reme mbering all the times she and Michael had used hotel \\nrooms to make love, gave her a feeling of desolation. It was that more than anything \\nelse that gave her the idea of calling Michael’s mother out in Long Beach. \\nThe phone was answered by a rough masculine voice with a typical, to her, New York \\naccent. Kay asked to speak to Mrs. Corelone. There was a few minutes’ silence and \\nthen Kay heard the heavily accented voice asking who it was. \\nKay was a little embarrassed now. “This is Kay Adams, Mrs. Corleone,” she said. “Do \\nyou remember me?” \\n“Sure, sure, I remember you, ” Mrs. Corleone said. “How come you no call up no more? \\nYou get a married?” \\n“Oh, no,” Kay said. “I’ve been busy.” She was surprised at the mother obviously being \\nannoyed that she had st opped calling. “Have you heard anythi ng from Michael? Is he all \\nright” \\nThere was silence at the other end of the phone and then Mrs. Corleorie’s voice came \\nstrong. “Mikey is a home. He no call you up? He no see you?” \\nKay felt her stomach go weak from shock and a humiliating desire to weep. Her voice \\nbroke a little when she asked, “How long has he been home?” \\nMrs. Corleone said, “Six months.” \\n“Oh, I see,” Kay said. And she did. She felt  hot waves of shame that Michael’s mother \\nknew he was treating her so cheaply. And then she was angry.  Angry at Michael, at his \\nmother, angry at all foreigners, Italians w ho didn’t have the common courtesy to keep up \\na decent show of friendship even if a love  affair was over. Didn’t Michael know she \\nwould be concerned for him as a friend even if he no longer wanted her for a bed \\ncompanion, even if he no longer wanted to marry her? Did he think she was one of  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 301\\nthose poor benighted Italian girls who would commit suicide or make a scene after \\ngiving up her virginity and then being thrown over? But she kept her voice as cool as \\npossible. “I see, thank you very much,” she said. “I’m glad Michael is home again and all \\nright. I just wanted to know. I won’t call you again.” \\nMrs. Corleone’s voice came impatiently over the phone as if she had heard nothing that \\nKay had said. “You wanta see Mikey, you come  out here now. Give him a nice surprise. \\nYou take a taxi, and I tell the man at the gate to pay the taxi for you. You tell the taxi \\nman he gets two times his clock, otherwise he no come way out the Long Beach. But \\ndon’t you pay. My husband’s man at the gate pay the taxi.” \\n“I couldn’t do that, Mrs. Corleone,” Kay said coldly. “If Michael wanted to see me, he \\nwould have called me at home before this. Obviously, he doesn’t want to resume our \\nrelationship.” \\nMrs. Corleone’s voice came briskly over the phone.  “You a very nice girl, you gotta nice \\nlegs, but you no gotta much brains.” She chu ckled. “You come out to see me, not Mikey. \\nI wanta talk to you. You come right now. An’ no pay the taxi. I wait for you.” The phone \\nclicked. Mrs. Corleone had hung up. \\nKay could have called back and said she wasn ’t coming but she knew she had to see \\nMichael, to talk to him, even if it was just  polite talk. If he was home now, openly, that \\nmeant he was no longer in trouble, he could live normally . She jumped off the bed and \\nstarted to get ready to see him. She took a great deal of care with her makeup and \\ndress. When she was ready to leave she star ed at her reflection in the mirror. Was she \\nbetter-looking than when Michael had disappear ed? Or would he find her unattractively \\nolder? Her figure had become more womanly,  her hips rounder, her breasts fuller. \\nItalians liked that supposedly, though Michael  had always said he loved her being so \\nthin. It didn’t matter really, Michael obvious ly didn’t want anything to do with her \\nanymore, otherwise he most certainly would have called in the six months he had been \\nhome. \\nThe taxi she hailed refused to take her to Long Beach until she gave  him a pretty smile \\nand told him she would pay double the mete r. It was nearly an hour’s ride and the mall \\nin Long Beach had changed since she last saw it. There were iron fences around it and \\nan iron gate barred the mall entrance. A man wearing slacks and a white jacket over a \\nred shirt opened the gate, poked  his head into the cab to read the meter and gave the \\ncab driver some bills. Then w hen Kay saw the driver was not protesting and was happy  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 302\\nwith the money paid, she got out and walked across the ma ll to the central house. \\nMrs. Corleone herself opened the door and gr eeted Kay with a wa rm embrace that \\nsurprised her. Then she surveyed Kay with an  appraising eye. “You a beautiful girl,” she \\nsaid flatly. “I have stupid sons.” She pu lled Kay inside the door and led her to the \\nkitchen, where a platter of food was alread y set out and a pot of coffee perked on the \\nstove. “Michael comes home pretty soon,” she said. “You surprise him.” \\nThey sat down together and the old wom an forced Kay to eat, meanwhile asking \\nquestions with great curiosity.  She was delighted that Kay was a schoolteacher and that \\nshe had come to New York to visit old girl friends and that Kay was only twenty-four \\nyears old. She kept nodding he r head as if all the facts accorded with some private \\nspecifications in her mind. Kay was so nervous that she just answered the questions, \\nnever saying anything else. \\nShe saw him first through the kitchen window. A car pulled up in front of the house and \\nthe two other men got out. Then Michael. He straightened up to talk with one of the \\nother men. His profile, the left  one, was exposed to her view . It was cracked, indented, \\nlike the plastic face of a doll that a child has wantonly kicked.  In a curious way it did not \\nmar his handsomeness in her eyes but moved her to tears. She saw him put a \\nsnow-white handkerchief to his mouth and nee and hold it there for a moment while he \\nturned away to come into the house. \\nShe heard the door open and his foot steps in the hall turning into the kitchen and then \\nhe was in the open space, s eeing her and his mother. He seemed impassive, and then \\nhe smiled ever so slightly, t he broken half of his face halti ng the widening of his mouth. \\nAnd Kay, who had want just to say “Hello, how are you,” in  the coolest possible way, \\nslipped out of her seat to run into his ar ms, bury her face against his shoulder. He \\nkissed her wet cheek and held her until sh e finished weeping and then he walked her \\nout to his car, waved his bodyguard away and drove off with her beside him, she \\nrepairing her makeup by simply wiping what was left of it away with her handkerchief. \\n“I never meant to do that,” Kay said. “It’s ju st that nobody told me how badly they hurt \\nyou.” \\nMichael laughed and touched the broken side of his face. “You mean this? That’s \\nnothing. Just gives me sinus trouble. Now that I’m home I’ll probably get it fixed. I \\ncouldn’t write you or anything,” Michael said. “You have to understand that before anything else.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 303\\n“OK,” she said. \\n“I’ve got a place in the city,” Michael said. “Is it all right if  we go there or should it be \\ndinner and drinks at  a restaurant?” \\n“I’m not hungry,” Kay said. \\nThey drove toward New York in silence fo r a while. “Did you get  your degree?” Michael \\nasked. \\n“Yes,” Kay said. “I’m teaching grade school in my hometown now. Did they find the man \\nwho really killed the policeman, is that why you were able to come home?” \\nFor a moment Michael didn’t answer. “Yes, they  did,” he said. “It was in all the New York \\npapers. Didn’t you read about it?” \\nKay laughed with the relief of him denying he was a murderer. “We only get The New \\nYork Times up in our town,” she said. “I gue ss it was buried back in page eighty-nine. If \\nI’d read about it I’d have called your mot her sooner.” She paused and then said, “It’s \\nfunny, the way your mother us ed to talk, I almost believed you had done it. And just \\nbefore you came, while we were  drinking coffee, she told me about that crazy man who \\nconfessed.” \\nMichael said, “Maybe my mother  did believe it at first.” \\n“Your own mother?” Kay asked. \\nMichael grinned. “Mothers are like cops . They always believe the worst.” \\nMichael parked the car in a garage on Mulbe rry Street where the owner seemed to \\nknow him. He took Kay ar ound the corner to what lo oked like a fairly decrepit \\nbrownstone house which fitted into the run down neighborhood. Michael had a key to the \\nfront door and when they we nt inside Kay saw that it was as expensively and \\ncomfortably furnished as a millionaire’s town  house. Michael led her to the upstairs \\napartment which consisted of an enormous living room, a huge kitchen and door that led \\nto the bedroom. In one corner of the living room was a bar and Michael mixed them both \\na drink. They sat on a sofa together and Michael said quietly, “We might as well go into the bedroom.” Kay took a long pull from her drink and smiled at him. “Yes,” she said. \\nFor Kay the lovemaking was almost like it  had been before except  that Michael was \\nrougher, more direct, not as tender as he ha d been. As if he were on guard against her. \\nBut she didn’t want to complain. It would w ear off. In a funny way, men were more \\nsensitive in a situation like this, she though t. She had found making love to Michael after  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 304\\na two-year absence the most natural thing in the world. It was as if he had never been \\naway. \\n“You could have written me, you could have trus ted me,” she said, nestling against his \\nbody. “I would have practiced the New England omerta. Yankees are pretty \\nclosemouthed too, you know.” \\nMichael laughed softly in the dar kness. “I never figured you to be waiting,” he said. “I \\nnever figured you to wait after what happened.” \\nKay said quickly, “I never believed you kill ed those two men. Except maybe when your \\nmother seemed to think so. But I never believ ed it in my heart. I know you too well.” \\nShe could hear Michael give a sigh. “It doesn ’t matter whether I di d or not,” he said. \\n“You have to understand that.” \\nKay was a little stunned by the coldness in his voice. She said , “So just tell me now, did \\nyou or didn’t you?” \\nMichael sat up on his pillow and in the dark ness a light flared as  he got a cigarette \\ngoing. “If I asked you to marry me, would I have to answer that question first before \\nyou’d give me an answer to mine?” \\nKay said, “I don’t care, I love you, I don’t care . If you loved me you wouldn’t be afraid to \\ntell me the truth. You wouldn’t be afraid I mi ght tell the police. That’s it, isn’t it? You’re \\nreally a gangster then, isn’t that  so? But I really don’t care. What I care about is that you \\nobviously don’t love me. You didn’t even call me up when you got back home.” \\nMichael was puffing on his cigarette and some burning ashes fell on Kay’s bare back. \\nShe flinched a little and said jokingly , “Stop torturing me, I won’t talk.” \\nMichael didn’t laugh. His voice sounded absentminded. “You know, when I came home I wasn’t that glad when I saw my family, my  father, my mother, my sister Connie, and \\nTom. It was nice but I didn’t really give a damn. Then I came home tonight and saw you \\nin the kitchen and I was glad. Is that what you mean by love?” \\n“That’s close enough for me,” Kay said. \\nThey made love again for a while. Michael was more tender this time. And then he went \\nout to get them both a drink. When he came back he sat on an armchair facing the bed. \\n“Let’s get serious,” he said. “How do you feel about marrying me?” Kay smiled at him \\nand motioned him into the bed. Michael smiled back at her. “Be serious,” he said. “I can’t tell you about anything that happened. I’m working for my fa ther now. I’m being  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 305\\ntrained to take over the family olive oil business. But you know my family has enemies, \\nmy father has enemies. You might be a very  young widow, there’s a chance, not much \\nof one, but it could happen. And I won’t be telling you what happened at the office every day. I won’t be telling you anything about my bus iness. You’ll be my wife but you won’t \\nbe my partner in life, as I think they say. Not an equal partner. That can’t be.” \\nKay sat up in bed. She switched on a huge la mp standing on the night table and then \\nshe lit a cigarette. She leaned back on the pillo ws and said quietly, “You’re telling me \\nyou’re a gangster, isn’t that it? You’re telli ng me that you’re responsible for people being \\nkilled and other sundry crimes rela ted to murder. And that I’m not ever to ask about that \\npart of your life, not even to think about it. Just like in the horror movies when the monster asks the beautiful girl to marry hi m.” Michael grinned, th e cracked part of his \\nface turned toward her, and Kay said in cont rition, “Oh, Mike, I don’t even notice that \\nstupid thing, I swear I don’t.” \\n“I know,” Michael said  laughing. “I like having it now exc ept that it make s the snot drip \\nout of my nose.” \\n“You said be serious,” Kay went on. “If we get married what kind of a life am I supposed \\nto lead? Like your mother, like an Italian hous ewife with just the kids and home to take \\ncare of? And what about if something happens? I suppose you could wind up in jail \\nsomeday.” \\n“No, that’s not possible,” Michael  said. “Killed, yes; jail, no.” \\nKay laughed at this confidence,  it was a laugh that had a f unny mixture of pride with its \\namusement. “But how can you sa y that?” she said. “Really.” \\nMichael sighed. “These are all the things I can’ t talk to you about, I don’t want to talk to \\nyou about.” \\nKay was silent for a long time. “Why do you want me to marry you after never calling me all these months? Am I so good in bed?” \\nMichael nodded gravely. “Sure,” he said. “But I’m getting it for nothing so why should I \\nmarry you for that? Look, I don’t want an answer now. We’re going to keep seeing each \\nother. You can talk it over with your parents. I hear your fa ther is a real tough guy in his \\nown way. Listen to his advice.” \\n“You haven’t answered why, why you want to marry me,” Kay said. \\nMichael took a white handkerchief from the draw er of the night table and held it to his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 306\\nnose. He blew into it and t hen wiped. “There’s the best reas on for not marrying me,” he \\nsaid. “How would that be having a guy ar ound who always has to blow his nose?” \\nKay said impatiently, “Come on, be serious, I asked you a question.” \\nMichael held the handkerchief in his hand. “OK,” he said, “this one time. You are the \\nonly person I felt any affection for, that I care about. I didn’ t call you because it never \\noccurred to me that you’d still be interest ed in me after everything that’s happened. \\nSure, I could have chased you, I could have conned you, but I didn’t  want to do that. \\nNow here’s something I’ll trust you with and I don’t want you to repeat it even to your \\nfather. If everything goes right, the Corleone Family will be completely legitimate in \\nabout five years. Some very tricky things ha ve to be done to make that possible. That’s \\nwhen you may become a wealthy widow. Now w hat do I want you for? Well, because I \\nwant you and I want a family. I want kids; it’s time. And I don’t want those kids to be \\ninfluenced by me the way I was influenced by my father. I don’t mean my father \\ndeliberately influenced me. He  never did. He never even  wanted me in the family \\nbusiness. He wanted me to become a professor or a doctor, something like that. But \\nthings went bad and I had to fight for my Family. I had to fight bec ause l love and admire \\nmy father. I never knew a man more wort hy of respect. He was a good husband and a \\ngood father and a good friend to people who were  not so fortunate in life. There’s \\nanother side to him, but that’s not relevant to me as his son. Anyway I don’t want that to \\nhappen to our kids. I want them to be influenced by you. I want them to grow up to be \\nAll-American kids, real All-Am erican, the whole works. May be they or their grandchildren \\nwill go into politics.” Michael  grinned. “Maybe one of them will be President of the United \\nStates. Why the hell not? In my history co urse at Dartmouth we did some background \\non all the Presidents and they had fathers and grandfathers who were lucky they didn’t \\nget hanged. But I’ll settle for my kids being doctors or musicians or teachers. They’ll \\nnever be in the Family business. By the time they are th at old I’ll be retired anyway. And \\nyou and I will be part of some country club  crowd, the good simple life of well-to-do \\nAmericans. How dote that strike you for a proposition?” \\n“Marvelous,” Kay said. “But you sort of skipped ones the widow part.” \\n“There’s not much chance of that . I just mentioned it to give a fair presentation.” Michael \\npatted his nose with the handkerchief. \\n“I can’t believe it, I can’t belie ve you’re a man like that, y ou’re just not,” Kay said. Her \\nface had a bewildered look. “I just don’t understand the whole thing, how it could  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 307\\npossibly be.” \\n“Well, I’m not giving any more explanations,”  Michael said gently. “You know, you don’t \\nhave to think about any of this stuff, it has  nothing to do with you really, or with our life \\ntogether if we get married.” \\nKay shook her head. “How can you want to marry me, how can you hint that you love \\nme, you never say the word but you just now said you loved your father, you never said \\nyou loved me, how could you if you distrust me so much you can’ t tell me about the \\nmost important things in y our life? How can you want to  have a wife you can’t trust? \\nYour father trusts your  mother. I know that.” \\n“Sure,” Michael said. “But that doesn’t mean  he tells her everything. And, you know, he \\nhas reason to trust her. Not because they  got married and she’s his wife. But she bore \\nhim four children in times when it was not that safe to bear children. She nursed and \\nguarded him when people shot him. She believed in him. He was always her first loyalty \\nfor forty years. After you do that maybe I’ll te ll you a few things you really don’t want to \\nhear.” \\n“Will we have to live in the mall?” Kay asked. \\nMichael nodded. “We’ll have our own house, it won’t be so bad. My parents don’t \\nmeddle. Our lives will be our own. But unt il everything gets straightened out, I have to \\nlive in the mall.” \\n“Because it’s dangerous for you to  live outside it,” Kay said. \\nFor the first time since she had come to kn ow him, she saw Michael angry. It was cold \\nchilling anger that was not externalized in any gesture or change in voice. It was a \\ncoldness that came off him like death and Kay k new that it was this coldness that would \\nmake her decide not to marry  him if she so decided. \\n“The trouble is all that damn trash in the movies and the news papers,” Michael said. \\n“You’ve got the wrong idea of my father and the Corleone Family. I’ll make a final \\nexplanation and this one will be really final. My father is a businessman trying to provide for his wife and children and those friends he might need someday in a time of trouble. \\nHe doesn’t accept the rules of the societ y we live in bgcause those rules would have \\ncondemned him to a life not suitable to a m an like himself, a man of extraordinary force \\nand character. What you have to  understand is that he consider s himself the equal of all \\nthose great men like Presi dents and Prime Ministers and S upreme Court Justices and \\nGovernors of the States. He refuses to liv e by rules set up by others, rules which  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 308\\ncondemn him to a defeated life. But his ultima te aim is to enter that society with a \\ncertain power since society do esn’t really protect its me mbers who do not have their \\nown individual power. In t he meantime he operates on a code of ethics he considers far \\nsuperior to the legal st ructures of society.” \\nKay was looking at him incredulously. “But that’s ridiculous,” she said. “What if \\neverybody felt the same way? How could so ciety ever function, we’d be back in the \\ntimes of the cavemen. Mike, you don’t believe what you’re saying, do you?” \\nMichael grinned at her. “I’m ju st telling you what my father believes. I just want you to \\nunderstand that whatever else he is, he’s not irresponsible , or at least not in the society \\nwhich he has created. He’s not a crazy machine-gunning mobster as you seem to think. \\nHe’s a responsible man in his own way.” \\n“And what do you believe?” Kay asked quietly. \\nMichael shrugged. “I believe in my family,” he said. “I believe in you and the family we \\nmay have. I don’t trust society to protect us, I have no intention of pl acing my fate in the \\nhands of men where only qualif ication is that they managed to con a block of people to \\nvote for them. But that’s for now. My fat her’s time is done. The things he did can no \\nlonger be done exeept wilt a great deal of risk. Whether we like it or not the Corleone \\nFamily has to join that society.  But when they do I’d like us  to join it with plenty of our \\nown power; that is, money an d ownership of other valuables. I’d like to make my \\nchildren as secure as possible before  they join that general destiny.” \\n“But you volunteered to fight for your country, you were a war hero,” Kay said. “What happened to make you change?” \\nMichael said, “’This is really getting us no place. But maybe I’m just one of those real \\nold-fashioned conservatives they grow up in  your hometown. I take care of myself, \\nindividual. Governments really don’t do much fo r their people, that’s what it comes down \\nto, but that’s not it really. All I can say, I hav e to help my father, I have to be on his side. \\nAnd you have to make your decision about being on my side.” He smiled at her. “I guess \\ngetting. married was a bad idea.” \\nKay patted the bed. “I don’t know about marry ing, but I’ve gone without a man for two \\nyears and I’m not letting you off so easy now. Come on in here.” \\nWhen they were in bed together, the light out, she whispered to him, “Do you believe me about not having a man since you left?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 309\\n“I believe you,” Michael said. \\n“Did you?” she whispered in a softer voice. \\n“Yes,” Michael said. He felt her stiffen a little. “But not in the last si x months.” It was true. \\nKay was the first woman he had made love  to since the death of Apollonia. \\nChapter 26 \\nThe garish suite overlooked the fake fairyland grounds in the r ear of the hotel; \\ntransplanted palm trees lit up by climber s of orange lights, tw o huge swimming pools \\nshimmering dark blue by the light of the deser t stars. On the horiz on were the sand and \\nstone mountains that ringed Las  Vegas nestling in its neon valley. Johnny Fontane let \\nthe heavy, richly embroidered gray drape fall and turned back to the room. \\nA special detail of four m en, a pit boss, a dealer, extr a relief man, and a cocktail \\nwaitress in her scanty nightclub  costume were getting things ready for private action. \\nNino Valenti was lying on the sofa in the livi ng room part of the suite, a water glass of \\nwhiskey in his hand. He watched the peopl e from the casino setting up the blackjack \\ntable with the proper six padded  chairs around its horseshoe outer rim. “That’s great, \\nthat’s great,” he said in a slurred vote that  was not quite drunken. “Johnny, come on and \\ngamble with me against these ba stards. I got the luck. We’ll beat their crullers in.” \\nJohnny sat on a footstool opposite the couch.  “You know I don’t gamble,” he said: “How \\nyou feeling, Nino?” \\nNino Valenti grinned at him.  “Great. I got broads comi ng up at midnight, then some \\nsupper, then back to the blackjack table. You know I got the house beat for almost fifty \\ngrand and they’ve been gri nding me for a week?” \\n“Yeah;” Johnny Fontane said. “Who do you w ant to leave it to when you croak?” \\nNino drained his glass empt y. “Johnny, where the hell did you get your rep as a \\nswinger? You’re a deadhead, Johnny. Christ, t he tourists in this town have more fun \\nthan you do.” \\nJohnny said, “Yeah. You want a lift to that blackjack table?” \\nNino struggled erect on the sofa and pleated his feet firmly on the rug. “I can make it,” \\nhe said. He let the glass slip to the floor and got up and walked quite steadily to where \\nthe blackjack table had been set up. The dealer was ready . The pit boss stood behind \\nthe dealer watching. The relief  dealer sat on a chair away fr om the table. The cocktail  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 310\\nwaitress sat on another chair in a line of vi sion so that she could see any of Nino \\nValenti’s gestures. \\nNino rapped on the green baize with hi s knuckles. “Chips,” he said. \\nThe pit boss took a pad from his pocket and filled out a slip and put it in front of Nino \\nwith a small fountain pen.  “Here you are, Mr. Valenti,” he said. “The usual five thousand \\nto start.” Nino scrawled his signature on the bo ttom of the slip and the pit boss put it in \\nhis pocket. He nodded to the dealer. \\nThe dealer with incredibly deft fingers took stacks of black and go ld one-hundred-dollar \\ndaps from the built-in racks before him. In not more than fire seconds Nino had five even \\nstacks of one-hundred-dollar chips before him, each stack had ten chips. \\nThere were six squares a little larger than playing card shapes etched in white on the \\ngreen baize, each square placed to correspond to where a player would sit. Now Nino \\nwas placing bets on three of these squares , single chips, and so playing three hands \\neach for a hundred dollars. He refused to take a hit on ail three hands because the dealer had a six up, a bust ca rd, and the dealer did bust. Nino raked in his chips and \\nturned to Johnny Fontane. “That’s how to start the night, huh, Johnny?” \\nJohnny smiled. It was unusual for a gambler like Nino to have to sign a chit while \\ngambling. A word was usually good enough for the high rollers. Maybe they were afraid \\nNino wouldn’t remember his take-out because of his drinking. They didn’t know that \\nNino remembered everything. \\nNino kept winning and after t he third round lifted a finger at  the cocktail waitress. She \\nwent to the bar at the end of  the room and brought him his usual rye in a water glass. \\nNino took the drink, switched it to his other hand so he could put an arm around the \\nwaitress. “Sit with me, honey, play a few hands; bring me luck.” \\nThe cocktail waitress was a very beautiful gi rl, but Johnny could see she was all cold \\nhustle; no real personality, though she worked at  it. She was giving Nino a big smile but \\nher tongue was hanging out for one of those black and gold chips.  What the hell, Johnny \\nthought, why shouldn’t she get some of it? He  just regretted that Nino wasn’t getting \\nsomething better for his money. \\nNino let the waitress play his hands for a fe w rounds and then gave her one of the chips \\nand a pat on the behind to send her away from  the table. Johnny motioned to her to \\nbring him a drink. She did so but she did it as if she were  playing the most dramatic \\nmoment in the most dramatic  movie ever made. She turned all her charm on the great  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 311\\nJohnny Fontane. She made her eyes sparkle wi th invitation, her walk was the sexiest \\nwalk ever walked, her mouth was, very slight ly parted as if she were ready to bite the \\nnearest object of her obvious passion. She re sembled nothing so much as a female \\nanimal in heat, but it was a deliberate act. Johnny Fontane thought, oh, Christ, one of \\nthem. It was the most popular approach of women who wanted to take him to bed. It \\nonly worked when he was very drunk and he wasn’t drunk no w. He gave the girl one of \\nhis famous grins and said, “T hank you, honey.” The girl l ooked at him and parted her \\nlips in a thank-you smile, her eyes went a ll smoky, her body tensed with the torso \\nleaning slightly back from the long tapering legs in their me sh stockings. An enormous \\ntension seemed to be building up in her body, her breasts seemed to grow fuller and \\nswell burstingly against her thin  scantily cut blouse. Then her whole body gave a slight \\nquiver that almost let off a sexual twang. The whole impression was one of a woman \\nhaving an orgasm simply because Johnny Fontane had smiled at her and said, “Thank \\nyou, honey.” It was very well done. It was done better than Johnny had ever seen it \\ndone before. But by now he knew it was fa ke. And the odds were always good that the \\nbroads who did it were a lousy lay. \\nHe watched her go back to her chair and nursed his drink slowly. He didn’t want to see \\nthat little trick again. He wasn’t in the mood for it tonight. \\nIt was an hour before Nino Valent i began to go. He started leaning first, wavered back, \\nand then plunged off the chair straight to the floor. But the pit boss and the relief dealer \\nhad been alerted by the first weave and caught  him before he hit the ground. They lifted \\nhim and carried him through the parted drapes t hat led to the bedroo m of the suite. \\nJohnny kept watching as the cocktail wa itress helped the other two men undress Nino \\nand shove him under the bed covers. The pi t boss was counting Nino’s chips and \\nmaking a note on his pad of chits, then guardi ng the table with its dealer’s chips. Johnny \\nsaid to him, “How long has that been going on?” \\nThe pit boss shrugged. “He went early tonight. The first time we got the house doc and \\nhe fixed Mr. Valenti up with something and gave him some sort of lecture. Then Nino \\ntold us that we shouldn’t call the doc w hen that happened, just put him to bed and he’d \\nbe OK in the morning. So that’s what we do. He’s pretty lucky, he was a winner again \\ntonight, almost three grand.” \\nJohnny Fontane said, “Well, let’s get the house doc up here tonight. OK? Page the casino floor if you have to.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 312\\nIt was almost fifteen minutes before Jules Sega l came into the suite. Johnny noted with \\nirritation that this guy never looked like a doctor. Tonight he was wearing a blue \\nloose-knit polo shirt with whit e trim, some sort of white suede shoes and no socks. He \\nlooked funny as hell carrying the traditional black doctor’s bag. \\nJohnny said, “You oughta figure out a way to ca rry your stuff in a cut-down golf bag.” \\nJules grinned understandingly, “Yeah, this medica l school carryall is a real drag. Scares \\nthe hell out of people. They should change the color anyway.” \\nHe went over to where Nino was lying in bed. As he opened his bag he said to Johnny. \\n“Thanks for that check you sent me as a c onsultant. It was excessive. I didn’t do that \\nmuch.” \\n“Like hell you didn’t,” Johnny said. “Anyway, forget that, that was a long time ago. \\nWhat’s with Nino?” \\nJules was making a quick exam ination of heartbeat, pulse and blood pressure. He took \\na needle out of his bag and shoved it casually into Nino’s arm and pressed the plunger. \\nNino’s sleeping face lost its waxy paleness, colo r came into the cheeks, as if the blood \\nhad started pumping faster. \\n“Very simple diagnosis,” Jules said briskl y. “I had a chance to examine him and run \\nsome tests when he first came here and faint ed. I had him moved to the hospital before \\nhe regained consciousness. He’s got diabetes, mild adult stabile, which is no problem if \\nyou take care of it with medication and diet  and so forth. He insists on ignoring it. Also \\nhe is firmly determined to drink himself to deat h. His liver is going  and his brain will go. \\nRight now he’s in a mild diabetic coma . My advice is to have him put away.” \\nJohnny felt a sense of relief. It couldn’t be t oo serious, all Nino had to do was take care \\nof himself. “You mean in one of those joints  where they dry you out?” Johnny asked. \\nJules went over to the bar in the far corner  of the room and made himself a drink. “No,” \\nhe said. “I mean committed. You know, the crazy house.” \\n“Don’t be funny,” Johnny said. \\n“I’m not joking,” Jules said. “I’m not up on all the psychiatric jazz but I know something \\nabout it, part of my trade. Your friend Nino can be put back into fairly good shape unless \\nthe liver damage has gone too far,  which we can’t know until  an autopsy really. But the \\nreal disease is in his head. In essence he d oesn’t care if he dies, maybe he even wants \\nto kill himself. Until that is cured there’s so hope for him. That’s why I say, have him  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 313\\ncommitted and then he can unde rgo the necessary psychiatric treatment.” \\nThere was a knock on the door  and Johnny went to answer it. It was Lucy Mancini. She \\ncame into Johnny’s arms and kissed him. “O h, Johnny, it’s so good to see you,” she \\nsaid. \\n“It’s been a long time,” Johnny Fontane sa id. He noticed that Lucy had changed. She \\nhad gotten much slimmer, her clothes were a hell of a lot better and she wore them \\nbetter. Her hair style fitted her face in a sort of boyish cut. She looked younger and \\nbetter than he had ever seen her and the thought  crossed his mind that she could keep \\nhim company here is Vegas. It would be a pleas ure hanging out with a real broad. But \\nbefore he could turn on the charm he remember ed she was the doc’s girl. So it was out. \\nHe made his smile just friendly and said , “What are you doing coming to Nino’s \\napartment at night, eh?” \\nShe punched him in the should er. “I heard Nino was sick and that Jules came up. I just \\nwanted to see if I could help. Nino’s OK, isn’t he?” \\n“Sure,” Johnny said. “He’ll be fine.” \\nJules Segal had sprawled out on  the couch. “Like hell he is ,” Jules said. “I suggest we \\nall sit here and wait for Nino to come to. And then we all talk him into committing \\nhimself. Lucy, he likes you, maybe you can hel p. Johnny, if you’re a real friend of his \\nyou’ll go along. Otherwise old Nino’s liver will shortly be exhi bit A in some university \\nmedical lab.” \\nJohnny was offended by the doctor’s flippant attitude. Who the hell did he think he was? \\nHe started to say so but Nino’s voice came from the bed, “Hey, old buddy, how, about a \\ndrink. \\nNino was sitting up in bed. He grinned at Lucy and said, “Hey , baby, come to old Nino.” \\nHe held his arms wide-open. Lucy sat on the edge of the bed and gave him a hug. \\nOddly enough Nino didn’t look bad at all now, almost normal. \\nNino snapped his fingers. “Com e on, Johnny, gimme a drink.  The night’s young yet. \\nWhere the hell’s my blackjack table?” \\nJules took a long slug from hi s own glass and said to Nino, “You can’t have a think. Your \\ndoctor forbids it.” \\nNino scowled. “Screw my actor.” Then a play-a cting look of contrition came on his face. \\n“Hey, Julie, that’s you. You’re my doctor,  right? I don’t mean you, old buddy. Johnny, get  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 314\\nme a drink or I get up out of bed sad get it myself.” \\nJohnny shrugged and moved toward the bar. Ju les said indifferently, “I’m saying he \\nshouldn’t have it.” \\nJohnny knew why Jules irritated him. The doctor’s voice was always cool, the words \\nnever stressed so matter how dire, the vo ice always low and controlled. If he gave a \\nwarning the warning was in the words alone, the voice itself was neutral, as if uncaring. \\nIt was this that made Johnny sore enough to bring Nino his water glass of whiskey. \\nBefore he handed it over he said to Jules, “This won’t kill him, right?” \\n“No, it won’t kill him,” Jules said calmly. Lucy gave him an anxious glance, started to say \\nsomething, then kept still. Meanwhile Nino had taken the whiskey and poured it down \\nhis throat. \\nJohnny was smiling down at Nino; they had shown the punk doctor. Suddenly Nino \\ngasped, his face seemed to turn blue, he coul dn’t catch his breath  and was choking for \\nair. His body leaped upward like  a fish, his face was gorged  with blood, his eyes bulging. \\nJules appeared on the other side of the bed facing Johnny and Lucy. He took Nino by \\nthe neck and held him still and plunged the needle into the shoulder near where it joined \\nthe neck. Nino went limp in his hands, the heaves of his body subsided, and after a \\nmoment he slumped down back onto his pillow. His eyes closed in sleep. \\nJohnny, Lucy and Jules went back into the living room part of the suite and sat around \\nthe huge solid coffee table.  Lucy picked up one of the aquamarine phones and ordered \\ncoffee and some food to be sent up. Johnny had gone over to the bar and mixed himself \\na drink. \\n“Did you know he would have that reacti on from the whiskey?” Johnny asked. \\nJules shrugged. “I was pretty sure he would.” \\nJohnny said sharply, “Then wh y didn’t you warn me?” \\n“I warned you,” Jules said. \\n“You didn’t warn me right,” Johnny said with  cold anger. “You are really one hell of a \\ndoctor. You don’t give a shit. You tell me to get Nino in a crazy house, you don’t bother to use a nice word like sanitorium. You r eally like to stick it to people, right?” \\nLucy was staring down in her lap. Jules kept  smiling at Fontane. “N othing was going to \\nstop you from giving Nino that drink. You had to show you didn’t have to accept my \\nwarnings, my orders. Remember  when you offered me a job as your personal physician  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 315\\nafter that throat business? I turned you down  because I knew we could never get along. \\nA doctor thinks he’s God, he’s the high priest  in modern society,  that’s one of his \\nrewards. But you would never treat me that wa y. I’d be a flunky God to you. Like those \\ndoctors you guys have in Hollywood. Where do you get those people from anyway? \\nChrist, don’t they know anything or don’t they just care? They must know what’s \\nhappening to Nino but they just give him all kinds of drugs to keep him going. They wear \\nthose silk suits and they kiss your ass because you’re a power movie man and so you \\nthink they are great doctors. Show biz, docs, you gotta have heart? Right? But they \\ndon’t give a fuck if you live or di e. Well, my little hobby, unforgi vable as it is, is to keep \\npeople alive. I let you give Nino that drink to show you what could happen to him.” Jules \\nleaned toward Johnny Fontane, his voice still calm, unemotional. “Your friend is almost \\nterminal. Do you understand that? He hasn’t got a chance without therapy and strict \\nmedical care. His blood pressure and diab etes and bad habits can cause a cerebral \\nhemorrhage in this very next instant. His brain wi ll blow itself apart. Is that vivid enough \\nfor you? Sure, I said crazy house. I want you to understand what’s needed. Or you won’t \\nmake a move. I’ll put it to you straight. Yo u can save your buddy’s life by having him \\ncommitted. Otherwise kiss him good-bye.” \\nLucy murmured, “Jules, darling, lutes,  don’t be so tough. Just tell him.” \\nJules stood up. His usual cool was gone, J ohnny Fontane noticed with satisfaction. His \\nvoice too had lost its quiet unaccented monotone. \\n“Do you think this is the first time I’ve had to talk to people like you in a situation like \\nthis?” Jules said. “I did it every day. Lu cy says don’t be so tough, but she doesn’t know \\nwhat she’s talking about. You know, I used to  tell people, “Don’t eat go much or you’ll \\ndie, don’t smoke so much or you’ll die, don’t work so much or you’ll die, don’t drink so \\nmuch or you’ll die.’ Nobody listens. You kn ow why? Because I don’t say, `You will die \\ntomorrow.’ Well, I can tell you that  Nino may very well die tomorrow.” \\nJules went over to the bar  and mixed himself another drin k. “How about it, Johnny, are \\nyou going to get Nino committed?” \\nJohnny said, “I don’t know.” \\nJules took a quick drink at the bar and filled his glass again. “You know, it’s a funny thing, you can smoke yourself to death, drink yourself to death, work yourself to death \\nand even eat yourself to death. But that’s all acceptable. The only thing you can’t do \\nmedically is screw yourself to death and yet that’s where they put all the obstacles.” He  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 316\\npaused to finish his drink. “But even that’s  trouble, for women anyway. I used to have \\nwomen who weren’t supposed to have any more babies. ‘It’s dangerous,’ I’d tell them. \\n‘You could die,’ I’d tell them. A nd a month later they pop in, their faces all rosy, and say, \\n‘Doctor, I think I’m pregnant,’ and sure enough t hey’d kill the rabbit. ‘But it’s dangerous,’ \\nI’d tell them. My voice used to have expressi on in those days. And they’d smile at me \\nand say, ‘But my husband and I are very  strict Catholics,’ they’d say.” \\nThere was a knock on the door and two waiters wheeled in a cart covered with food and \\nsilver service coffeepots. They took a portabl e table from the bottom of the cart and set \\nit up. Then Johnny dismissed them. \\nThey sat at the table and ate the hot sandwiches Lucy had ordered and drank the \\ncoffee. Johnny leaned back and lit up a cigarette. “So you save lives. How come you \\nbecame an abortionist?” \\nLucy spoke up for the first ti me. “He wanted to help girls in trouble, girls who might \\ncommit suicide or do something danger ous to get rid of the baby.” \\nJules smiled at her and sighed. “ It’s not that simple. I became  a surgeon finally. I’ve got \\nthe good hands, as ballplayers say. But I wa s so good I scared myself silly. I’d open up \\nsome poor bastard’s belly and know he was goi ng to die. I’d operate and know that the \\ncancer or tumor would come back but I’d s end them off home with a smile and a lot of \\nbullshit. Some poor broad comes in and I slic e off one tit. A year later she’s back and I \\nslice off the other tit. A year after that, I scoop out her insides like  you scoop the seeds \\nout of a cantaloupe. After all that she dies anyway. Meanwh ile husbands keep calling up \\nand asking, ‘What do the tests show? What do the tests show?’ \\n“So I hired an extra secretary to  take all those calls. I saw the patient only when she was \\nfully prepared for examination, tests or oper ation. I spent the minimum possible time \\nwith the victim because I was, after all, a busy man. And then finally I’d let the husband \\ntalk to me for two minutes. ‘ It’s terminal,’ I’d say. And they could never hear that last \\nword. They understood what it meant but they  never heard it. I thought at first that \\nunconsciously I was dropping my voice on the last  word, so I consciously said it louder. \\nBut still they never heard i t. One guy even said, ‘What the hell do you mean, it’s \\ngerminal?’” Jules started to laugh. “Germinal, terminal, what the hell. I started to do \\nabortions. Nice and easy, everybody happy, like washing the dishes and leaving a clean sink. That was my class. I loved it, I loved being an abortionist. I don’t believe that a \\ntwo-month fetus is a human being so no pr oblems there. I was helping young girls and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 317\\nmarried women who were in trouble, I was making good money. I was out of the front \\ntines. When I got caught I felt like a deserte r that had been hauled in. But I was lucky, a \\nfriend pulled some strings and got pie off but now the big hospitals won’t let me operate. \\nSo here I am. Giving good advice again which is being ignored just like in the old days.” \\n“I’m not ignoring it,” Johnny Fonta ne said. “I’m thinking it over.” \\nLucy finally changed the subject. “What are you doing in Vegas, Johnny? Relaxing from \\nyour duties as big-time Hollywood wheel or working?” \\nJohnny shook his head. “Mike Corleone wants to see me and have a ta lk. He’s flying in \\ntonight with Tom Hagen. Tom said they’ll be s eeing you, Lucy. You know what it’s all \\nabout?” \\nLucy shook her head. “We’re all having dinner tether tomorro w night. Freddie too. I think \\nit might have something to do with the hotel. The casino has been dropping money \\nlately, which shouldn’t be. The Don mi ght want Mike to check it out.” \\n“I hear Mike finally got hi s face fixed,” Johnny said. \\nLucy laughed. “I guess Kay talked him into i t. He wouldn’t do it when they were married. \\nI wonder why? It looked so awful and made his nose drip. He should have had it done sooner.” She paused for a moment. “Jules was called in by the Corleone Family for that \\noperation. They used him as a consultant and as observer.” \\nJohnny nodded and said dryly, “I recommended him for it.” \\n“Oh,” Lucy said. “Anyway, Mike said he want ed to do something for Jules. That’s why \\nhe’s having us to dinner tomorrow night.” \\nJules said musingly, “He didn’t trust anybody. He warned me to keep track of what everybody did. It was fairly straight, ordinar y surgery. Any compet ent man could do it.” \\nThere was a sound from the bedroom of the su ite and they looked toward the drapes. \\nNino had become concious aga in. Johnny went and sat on the bed. Jules and Lucy \\nwent over to the foot of the bed. Nino gave them a wan grin . “OK, I’ll stop being a wise \\nguy. I feel really lousy. Johnny, remem ber about a year ago, what happened when we \\nwere with those two broads down in Palm Spri ngs? I swear to you I wasn’t jealous about \\nwhat happened. I was glad. You believe me, Johnny?” \\nJohnny said reassuringly, “S ure, Nino, I believe you.” \\nLucy and Jules looked at eac h other. From everything they  had heard and knew about  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 318\\nJohnny Fontane it seemed impossible that he would take a gi rl away from a close friend \\nlike Nino. And why was Nino saying he wasn’t  jealous a year after it happened? The \\nsame thought crossed both their minds, t hat Nino was drinking himself to death \\nromantically because a girl had left him to go with Johnny Fontane. \\nJules checked Nino again. “I’ll get a nurse to be in the room with you tonight,” Jules \\nsaid. “You really have to stay in bed for a couple of days. No kidding.” \\nNino smiled. “OK, Doc, just don’ t make the nurse too pretty.” \\nJules made a call for the nurse and then he and Lucy left. Johnny sat in a chair near the bed to wait for the nurse. Nino was falling asleep again, an exhausted took on his face. \\nJohnny thought about what he had said, about not being jealous about what had \\nhappened over a year ago with t hose two broads down in Palm Springs. The thought \\nhad never entered his head that  Nino might be jealous. \\n* * *  \\nA year ago Johnny Fontane had sat in his plush office, the office of the movie company \\nhe headed, and felt as lousy as he had ever fe lt in his life. Which was surprising \\nbecause the first movie he had produced, with  himself as star an d Nino in a featured \\npart, was making tons of money. Everything had worked. Everybody had done their job. The picture was brought in under budget. Everybody was going to make a fortune out of \\nit and Jack Woltz was losing te n years of his life.  Now Johnny had two more pictures in \\nproduction, one starring himself, one starring Ni no. Nino was great on the screen as one \\nof those charming, dopey love r-boys that women loved to s hove between their tits. Little \\nboy lost. Everything he t ouched made money, it was rolli ng in. The Godfather was \\ngetting his percentage through th e bank, and that made Johnny f eel really g ood. He had \\njustified his Godfather’s faith. Bu t today that wasn’t helping much. \\nAnd now that he was a successful independent  movie producer he had as much power, \\nmaybe more, than he had ever had as a singer. Beautiful broads felt all over him just \\nlike before, though for a more commercial reason. He had his own plane, he lived more \\nlavishly even, with the spec ial tax benefits a businessman had that artists didn’t get. \\nThen what the hell was bothering him? \\nHe knew what it was. The front of his head hurt, his nas al passages hurt, his throat \\nitched. The only way he could scratch and relie ve that itch was by  singing and he was \\nafraid to even try. He had called Jules Segal about it, when it would be safe to try to sing \\nand Jules had said anytime he felt like i t. So he’d tried and sounded so hoarse and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 319\\nlousy he’d given up. And his throat would hur t like hell the next day, hurt in a different \\nway than before the warts had been taken off. Hu rt worse, burning. He was afraid to \\nkeep singing, afraid that he’d lose  his voice forever, or ruin it. \\nAnd if he couldn’t sing, what the hell was the use of everything else? Everything else \\nwas just bullshit. Sing was th e only thing he really knew. Maybe he knew more about \\nsinging and his kind of music than anybody else in the wo rld. He was that good, he \\nrealized now. All those years had made him a real  pro. Nobody could tell him, the right \\nand the wrong, he didn’t have to ask anybody. He knew. What a waste, what a damn \\nwaste. \\nIt was Friday and he decided to spend the weeken d with Virginia and the kids. He called \\nher up as he always did to tell her he was coming.  Really to give her a chance to say no. \\nShe never said no. Not in all the years they had been divorced.  Because she would \\nnever say no to a meeting of her daughters and their father. What a broad, Johnny \\nthought. He’d been lucky with Vi rginia. And though he knew  he cared more about her \\nthan any other woman he knew it was impossible for them to live together sexually. \\nMaybe when they were sixty-five, like when you retire, they’d retire together, retire from \\neverything. \\nBut reality shattered these tests when he arrived there and found Virg inia was feeling a \\nlittle grouchy herself and the two girls not t hat crazy to see him because they had been \\npromised a weekend visit with some girl fri ends on a California ranch where they could \\nride horses. \\nHe told Virginia to send the girls off to the ranch and kisse d them good-bye with an \\namused smile. He understood them  so well. What kid wouldn ’t rather go riding horses \\non a ranch than hang around with a grouchy fa ther who picked his own spots as a \\nfather. He said to Virginia, “I’ll have  a few drinks and then I’ll shove off too.” \\n“All right,” she said. She wa s having one of her bad days, rare, but recognizable. It \\nwasn’t too easy for her leading this kind of life. \\nShe saw him taking an extra large drink. “W hat are you cheering yourself up for?” \\nVirginia asked. “Everything is going so beauti fully for you. I never dreamed you had it in \\nyou to be such a good businessman.” \\nJohnny smiled at her. “It’s not so hard,” he said. At the same time he was thinking, so \\nthat’s what was wron g. He understood women and he u nderstood now that Virginia was \\ndown because she thought he wa s having everything his own way. Women really hated  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 320\\nseeing their men doing too well. It irritated them. It made them less sure of the hold they \\nexerted over them through affection, sexual custom or marriage ties. So more to cheer \\nher up than voice his own complaints, Johnny said, “What the hell difference does it \\nmake if I can’t sing.” \\nVirginia’s voice was annoyed. “Oh, Johnny, you’re not a kid anymore. You’re over \\nthirty-five. Why do you keep worrying about t hat silly singing stuff? You make more \\nmoney as a producer anyhow.” \\nJohnny looked at her curiously and said, “I’m  a singer. I love to sing. What’s being old \\ngot to do with that?” \\nVirginia was impatient. “I nev er liked your singing anyway.  Now that you’ve shown you \\ncan make movies, I’m glad you can’t sing anymore.” \\nThey were both surprised when Johnny said with fury, “That’s a fucking lousy thing to \\nsay.” He was shaken. How could Virginia feel  like that, how could she dislike him so \\nmuch? \\nVirginia smiled at his being hurt and because it was so out rageous that he should be \\nangry at her she said, “How do you think I fe lt when all those girls came running after \\nyou because of the way you sang? How would you feel if I went  ass-naked down the \\nstreet to get men running after me? That’s  what your singing was and I used to wish \\nyou’d lose your voice and could never sing agai n. But that was before we got divorced.” \\nJohnny finished his drink. “You don’t underst and a thing. Not a damn thing.” He went \\ninto the kitchen and dialed Nin o’s number. He quickly arranged for them both to go \\ndown to Palm Springs for the weekend and gave Nino the number of a girl to call, a real \\nfresh young beauty he’d been m eaning to get around to. “She’ll  have a friend for you,” \\nJohnny said. “I’ll be at your place in an hour.” \\nVirginia gave him a cool good- bye when he left. He didn’t give  a damn, it was one of the \\nfew times he was angry with her.  The hell with it, he’d just tear loose for the weekend \\nand get all the poison out of his system. \\nSure enough, everything was fine down in Palm Springs.  Johnny used his own house \\ndown there, it was always kept  open and staffed this time of  year. The two girls were \\nyoung enough to be great fun and not too rapacious for some kind of favor. Some \\npeople came over to keep them  company at the poo l until suppertime. Nino went to his \\nroom with his girl to get ready for supper  and a quick bang while he was still warm from \\nthe sun. Johnny wasn’t in the mood, so he sent his girl, a shor t bandbox blonde named  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 321\\nTina, up to shower by herself. He never could make love to another woman after he’d \\nhad a fight with Virginia. \\nHe went into the glass-walle d patio living room that hel d a piano. When singing with the \\nband he had fooled around with the piano just for laughs, so he could pick out a song in \\na fake moonlight-soft ballad style. He sat down now and hummed along a bit with the \\npiano, very softly, muttering a few words but not really singing. Before he knew it Tina was in the living room making him a drink a nd sitting beside him at the piano. He played \\na few tunes and she hummed with him. He left her at the piano and we nt up to take his \\nshower. In the shower he sang short phrases, more like speaking. He got dressed and went back down. Tina was still alone; Nino was really working his girl over or getting \\ndrunk. \\nJohnny sat down at the piano again while Tina wandered off outside to watch the pool. \\nHe started singing one of his old songs. There was no burning in his throat. The tones \\nwere coming out muted but with proper body. He looked at the patio. Tina was still out \\nthere, the glass door was closed, she wouldn ’t hear him. For some reason he didn’t \\nwant anybody to hear him. He started off fr esh on an old ballad that was his favorite. He \\nsang full out as if he were singing in public , letting himself go, waiting for the familiar \\nburning rasp in his throat but  there was none. He listened to  his voice, it was diferent \\nsomehow, but he liked it. It was darker, it was a man’s voice, not a kid’s, rich he thought, \\ndark rich. He finished the song easing up and sat there at the piano thinking about it. \\nBehind him Nino said, “Not bad, old buddy, not bad at all.” \\nJohnny swiveled his body around. Nino was st anding in the doorway, alone. His girl \\nwasn’t with him. Johnny was relieved. He didn’t mind Nino hearing him. \\n“Yeah,” Johnny said. “Let’s get rid of  those two broads. Send them home.” \\nNino said, “You send them home.  They’re nice kids, I’m not  gonna hurt their feelings. \\nBesides I just banged mine twice. How would it  look if I sent her away without even \\ngiving her dinner?” The hell with it, J ohnny thought. Let the girls listen even if he \\nsounded lousy. He called up a b and leader he knew in Palm Springs and asked him to \\nsend over a mandolin for Nino. The band l eader protested, “Hell, nobody plays a \\nmandolin in California.” Johnny yelled, “Just get one.” \\nThe house was loaded with reco rding equipment and Johnny ha d the two girls work the \\nturn-off and volumes. After they had dinner , Johnny went to work. He had Nino playing \\nthe mandolin as accompaniment  and sang all his old songs. He sang them all the way  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 322\\nout, not nursing his voice at all. His throat was fine, he felt th at he could sing forever. In \\nthe months he had not been ab le to sing he had often t hought about singi ng, planned \\nout how he would phrase lyrics differently now  than as a kid. He had sung the songs in \\nhis head with more sophisticated variations of emphasis. Now he was doing it for real. \\nSometimes it would go wrong in the actual singing, stuff that had sound good when he \\nheard it just in his head didn’ t work out when he tried it really singing out loud. OUT \\nLOUD, he thought. He wasn’t  listening to himself now, he was concentrating on \\nperforming. He fumbled a little on timing but  that was OK, just rusty. He had a \\nmetronome in his head that would never fail hi m. Just a little practice was all he needed. \\nFinally he stopped singing. Tina came over to him with eyes shining and gave him a \\nlong kiss. “Now I know why Mother goes to all your movies,” she said. It was the wrong \\nthing to say at any time exc ept this. Johnny and Nino laughed. \\nThey played the feedback and now Johnny c ould really listen to himself. His voice had \\nchanged, changed a hell of a lot but was st ill unquestionably the voice of Johnny \\nFontane. It had become much richer and darker  as he had noticed bef ore but there was \\nalso the quality of a man si nging rather than a boy. The vo ice had more true emotion, \\nmore character. And the technical part of hi s singing was far superi or to anything he had \\never done. It was nothing less than masterfu l. And if he was that good now, rusty as \\nhell, how good would he be when he got in shape again? Johnny gr inned at Nino. “Is \\nthat as good as I think it is?” \\nNino looked at his happy face thoughtfully. “ It’s very damn good,” he said. “But let’s see \\nhow you sing tomorrow.” \\nJohnny was hurt that Nino shou ld be so downbeat. “You son of  a bitch, you know you \\ncan’t sing like that. Don’t worry  about tomorrow. I feel great.” But he didn’t sing any more \\nthat night. He and Nino took the girls to a party and Tina spent the night in his_bed but \\nhe wasn’t much good there. T he girl was a little disappoint ed. But what the hell, you \\ncouldn’t do everything all in one day, Johnny thought. \\nHe woke up in the morning with a sense of apprehension, wi th a vague terror that he \\nhad dreamed his voice had come back. Then when  he was sure it was not a dream he \\ngot scared that his voice would be shot a gain. He went to the window and hummed a \\nbit, then he went down to the living room still in his pajamas. He picked out a tune on the \\npiano and after a while tried sing ing with it. He sang mutedly but there was no pain, no \\nhoarseness in his throat, so he turned it on. The cords were true. and rich, he didn’t  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 323\\nhave to force it at all. Easy, easy, just pouring out. Johnny realized that the bad time \\nwas over, he had it all now. And it didn’t matte r a damn if he fell on his face with movies, \\nit didn’t matter if he couldn’t get it up with Tina the night before; it didn’t matter that \\nVirginia would hate him being able to sing again. For a moment he had just one regret. If \\nonly his voice had come back to him while trying to sing for his daughters, how lovely \\nthat would have been. That would have been so lovely. \\n* * *  \\nThe hotel nurse had come into the room w heeling a cart loaded with medication. Johnny \\ngot up and stared down at Nino, who was sl eeping or maybe dying.  He knew Nino \\nwasn’t jealous of his getting his voice ba ck. He understood that Nino was only jealous \\nbecause he was so happy about getting his voice back. That he cared so much about singing. For what was very obvious now was that Nino Val enti didn’t care enough about \\nanything to make him want to stay alive. \\nChapter 27 \\nMichael Corleone arrived late in the evening and, by his own order, was not met at the \\nairport. Only two men acco mpanied him: Tom Hagen and a new bodyguard, named \\nAlbert Neri. \\nThe most lavish suite of room s in the hotel had been set asi de for Michael and his party. \\nAlready waiting in that suite were the people it would be necessary for Michael to see. \\nFreddie greeted his brother wit h a warm embrace. Freddie was much stouter, more \\nbenevolent-looking, cheerful, and far more dandi fied. He wore an exquisitely tailored \\ngray silk and accessories to match. His hair was razor cut and arranged as carefully as \\na movie star’s, his face glow ed with perfect barbering and his hands were manicured. \\nHe was an altogether different man than the one who had been shipped out of New \\nYork four years before. \\nHe leaned back and surveyed Mic hael fondly. “You look a hell  of a lot better now that \\nyou got your face fixed. Your  wife finally talked you into i t, huh? How is Kay? When she \\ngoons come out and visit us out here?” \\nMichael smiled at his brother. “You’re lookin g pretty good too. Kay would have come out \\nthis time, but she’s carrying another kid and she has the baby to look after. Besides this \\nis business, Freddie, I have to fly back tomorrow night or the morning after.” \\n“You have to eat something first,” Freddie said . “We’ve got a great chef in the hotel,  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 324\\nyou’ll get the best food you ever ate. Go ta ke your shower and change and everything \\nwill be set up right here. I have all the people you want to s ee lined up, they’ll be waiting \\naround for when you’re ready, I just have to call them.” \\nMichael said pleasantly, “Let’s save M oe Greene to the end, OK? Ask Johnny Fontane \\nand Nino up to eat with us. And Lucy and her doctor friend. We can talk while we eat.” \\nHe turned to Hagen. “Anybody you want to add to that, Tom?” \\nHagen shook his head. Freddie had greeted him much less affectionately than Michael, \\nbut Hagen understood. Freddie was on his father’s shit list and Freddie naturally blamed \\nthe Consigliere for not straightening things  out. Hagen would gladly have done so, but \\nhe didn’t know why Freddie was in his father’s  bad graces. The Don did not give voice to \\nspecific grievances. He just made his displeasure felt. \\nIt was after midnight before they gathered around the spec ial dinner table set up in \\nMichael’s suite. Lucy kissed Michael and didn’t comment on his face looking so much \\nbetter after the operation. Jules Segal boldly  studied the repaired cheekbone and said to \\nMichael, “A good job. It’s knitted nicely. Is the sinus OK?” \\n“Fine,” Michael said. “Thanks for helping out.” \\nDinner focused on Michael as they ate. They all noted his resemblance in speech and \\nmanner to the Don. In some curious way he  inspired the same respect, the same awe, \\nand yet he was perfectly natural, at pains to put everyone at their ease. Hagen as usual \\nremained in the background. The new man they did not know; Albert Neri was also very \\nquiet and unobtrusive. He had claimed he was not hungry and sat in an armchair close \\nto the door reading a local newspaper. \\nAfter they had had a few drinks and food, the wa iters were dismissed. Michael spoke to \\nJohnny Fontane. “Hear your voice is back as good as ever, you got all your old fans \\nback. Congratulations.” \\n“Thanks,” Johnny said. He was curious about exactly why Michael wanted to see him. \\nWhat favor would he be asked? \\nMichael addressed them all in  general. “The Corleone Fam ily is thinking of moving out \\nhere to Vegas. Selling out all our interests in  the olive oil business and settling here. The \\nDon and Hagen and myself have talked it over and we thin k here is where the future is \\nfor the Family. That doesn’t mean right now or next year. It may take two, three, even \\nfour years to get things squared away. But t hat’s the general plan. Some friends of ours \\nown a good percentage of this hotel and ca sino so that will be our foundation. Moe  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 325\\nGreene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the Family.” \\nFreddie’s moon face was anxious. “Mike, you sure about Moe Greene selling? He never \\nmentioned it to me and he loves the busi ness. I really don’t think he’ll sell.” \\nMichael said quietly, “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.” \\nThe words were said in an ordinary voice, yet the effect was chilling, perhaps because it \\nwas a favorite phrase of the Don’s. Michael turned to Johnny Fontane. “The Don is \\ncounting on you to help us get started. It ’s been explained to us that entertainment will \\nbe the big factor in drawing gamblers. We  hope you’ll sign a contract to appear five \\ntimes a year for maybe a week-long engagem ent. We hope your friends in movies do \\nthe same. You’ve done t hem a lot of favors, now you can call them in.” \\n“Sure,” Johnny said. “I’ll do anything for my Godfather, you know that, Mike.” But there \\nwas just the faint shadow of doubt in his voice. \\nMichael smiled and said, “You won’t lose  money on the deal and neither will your \\nfriends. You get points in the hotel, and if there’s somebody else you think important \\nenough, they get some points too. Maybe y ou don’t believe me, so let me say I’m \\nspeaking the Don’s words.” \\nJohnny said hurriedly, “I believe you, Mike . But there’s ten more hotels and casinos \\nbeing built on the Strip right now. When you come in, the market may be glutted, you \\nmay be too late with all that competition already there.” \\nTom Hagen spoke up. “The Corleone Family has friends who are financing three of \\nthose hotels.” Johnny understo od immediately that he m eant the Corleone Family \\nowned the three hotels, with their casinos. And that ther e would be plenty of points to \\ngive out. \\n“I’ll start working on it,” Johnny said. \\nMichael turned to Lucy and Jules Segal. “I owe you,” he said to Jules.  “I hear you want \\nto go back to cutting people up  and that hospitals won’t let you use their facilities \\nbecause of that old abortion business. I have to know from you, is that what you want?” \\nJules smiles. “I guess so. But you don’t know  the medical setup. Whatever power you \\nhave doesn’t mean anything to them. I’m af raid you can’t help me in that.” \\nMichael nodded absentmindedly. “S ure, you’re right. But some  friends of mine, pretty \\nwell-known people, are going to build a big hos pital for Las Vegas. The town will need it \\nthe way it’s growing and the wa y it’s projected to grow. Ma ybe they’ll let you into the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 326\\noperating room if it’s put to them right. He ll, how many surgeons as good as you can \\nthey get to come out to this desert? Or any half as good? We’ll be doing the hospital a \\nfavor. So stick around. I hear you and Lucy are going to get married?” \\nJules shrugged. “When I see that I have any future.” \\nLucy said wryly, “Mike, if you don’t build  that hospital, I’ll die an old maid.” \\nThey all laughed. All exce pt Jules. He said to Michael, “If I took a job like that there \\ncouldn’t be any strings attached.” \\nMichael said coldly, “No strings. I ju st owe you and I want to even out.” \\nLucy said gently, “Mi ke, don’t get sore.” \\nMichael smiled at her. “I’m not sore.” He tu rned to Jules. “That was a dumb thing for you \\nto say. The Corleone Family has pulled some st rings for you. Do you think I’m so stupid \\nI’d ask you to do things you’d hate to do? But if I did, so what? Who the hell else ever \\nlifted a finger to help you when you were in trouble? When I heard you wanted to get \\nback to being a real surgeon, I took a lot of time  to find out if I could help. I can. I’m not \\nasking you for anything. But at least you c an consider our relationship friendly, and I \\nassume you would do for me what you’d do for any good friend. That’s my string. But \\nyou can refuse it.” \\nTom Hagen lowered his head and smiled. Not even the Don himself could have done it \\nany better. \\nJules was flushing. “Mike, I didn ’t mean it that way at all. I’m very grateful to you and \\nyour father. Forget I said it.” \\nMichael nodded and said, “Fine. Until the hospital gets bu ilt and opens up you’ll be \\nmedical director for the four hotels. Get yo urself a staff. Your money goes up too, but \\nyou can discuss that with Tom at a later ti me. And Lucy, I want you to do something \\nmore important. Maybe coordinate all t he shops that will be opening up in the hotel \\narcades. On the financial side. Or maybe hiring the girls we need to work in the casinos. \\nsomething like that. So if Jules doesn’t marry you, you can be a rich old maid.” \\nFreddie had been puffing on his cigar angrily. Mic hael turned to him and said gently, “I’m \\njust the errand boy for the Don, Freddie. What  he wants you to do he’ll tell you himself, \\nnaturally, but I’m sure it will be somethi ng big enough to make you happy. Everybody \\ntells us what a great j ob you’ve been doing here.” \\n“Then why is he sore at me?” Freddie asked plaintively. “Just because the casino has  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 327\\nbeen losing money? I don’t control that end, Moe Greene does. What the hell does the \\nold man want from me?” \\n“Don’t worry about it,” Michael said. He tu rned to Johnny Fontane. “Where’s Nino? I was \\nlooking forward to seeing him again.” \\nJohnny shrugged. “Nino is pretty sick. A nurse is taking care of him in his room. But the \\ndoc here says he should be committed, that  he’s trying to kill himself. Nino!” \\nMichael said thoughtfully, really surprised,  “Nino was always a real good guy. I never \\nknew him to do anything lousy, say anyth ing to put anybody down. He never gave a \\ndamn about anything. Except the booze.” \\n“Yeah,” Johnny said. “The money is rolling in, he could get a lot of work, singing or in the \\nmovies. He gets fifty grand a picture now and he blows it. He doesn’t give a damn about \\nbeing famous. All the years we’ve been buddies  I’ve never known him to do anything \\ncreepy. And the son of a bitch is  drinking himself to death.” \\nJules was about to say somethin g when there was a knock on the door of the suite. He \\nwas surprised when the man in the armchai r, the man nearest the door, did not answer \\nit but kept reading the newsp aper. It was Hagen who went to  open it. And was almost \\nbrushed aside when Moe Greene came stridi ng into the room followed by his two \\nbodyguards. \\nMoe Greene was a handsome hood who had made his rep as a Murder Incorporated \\nexecutioner in Brooklyn. He had branched out into gambling and gone west to seek his \\nfortune, had been the first person to see the possi bilities of Las Vegas and built one of \\nthe first hotel casinos on the Strip. He st ill had murderous tantrums  and was feared by \\neveryone in the hotel, not excluding Freddie , Lucy and Jules Segal. They always stayed \\nout of his way whenever possible. \\nHis handsome face was grim now. He said to Michael Corleone, “I’ve been waiting \\naround to talk to you, Mike. I got  a lot of things to do tomo rrow so I figured I’d catch you \\ntonight. How about it?” \\nMichael Corleone looked at him with what s eemed to be friendly astonishment. “Sure,” \\nhe said. He motioned in Hagen’s direct ion. “Get Mr. Greene a drink, Tom.” \\nJules noticed that the man called Albert Neri was studying Moe Greene intently, not \\npaying any attention to the bodyguards who were leaning against the door. He knew \\nthere was no chance of any violenc e, not in Vegas itself. That was strictly forbidden as  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 328\\nfatal to the whole project of making Vegas the legal sanctuary of American gamblers. \\nMoe Greene said to his bodyguards, “Draw some chips for all these people so that they \\ncan gamble on the house.” He obviously meant Jules, Lucy, Johnny Fontane and \\nMichael’s bodyguard, Albert Neri. \\nMichael Corleone nodded agreeably. “That’s a good idea.” It was only then that Neri got \\nout of his chair and prepared to follow the others out. \\nAfter the good-byes were said, there we re Freddie, Tom Hagen, Moe Greene and \\nMichael Corleone left in the room. \\nGreene put his drink down on the table and said with barely controlled fury, “What’s this \\nI hear the Corleone Family is going to buy me out? I’ll buy you out. You don’t buy me \\nout.” \\nMichael said reasonably, “Your casino has been losing money against all the odds. \\nThere’s something wrong with the way y ou operate. Maybe we can do better.” \\nGreene laughed harshly. “You goddamn Dagos, I do you a favor and take Freddie in \\nwhen you’re having a bad time and now you push me out. That’s  what you think. I don’t \\nget pushed out by nobody and I got friends that will back me up.” \\nMichael was still quietly reasonable. “You to ok Freddie in because the Corleone Family \\ngave you a big chunk of money to finish fu rnishing your hotel. And bankroll your casino. \\nAnd because the Molinari Family on the C oast guaranteed his safety and gave you \\nsome service for taking him in. The Corl eone Family and you are evened out. I don’t \\nknow what you’re getting sore about. We’ll bu y your share at any reasonable price you \\nname, what’s wrong with that? What’s unfair about that? With  your casino losing money \\nwe’re doing you a favor.” \\nGreene shook his head. “The Corleone Family  don’t have that much muscle anymore. \\nThe Godfather is sick. You’re getting chased out of New York by the other Families and you think you can find easier pickings here. I ’ll give you some advice, Mike, don’t try.” \\nMichael said softly, “Is that why you t hought you could slap Freddie around in public?” \\nTom Hagen, startled, turned his attention to Freddie. Freddie Corleone’s face was \\ngetting red. “Ah, Mike, that wasn’t anything.  Moe didn’t mean anythi ng. He flies off the \\nhandle sometimes, but me and hi m are good friends. Right, Moe?” \\nGreene was wary. “Yeah, sure. Sometimes I got to kick asses to make this place run \\nright. I got sore at Freddie because he was banging all the cocktail waitresses and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 329\\nletting them goof off on the j ob. We had a little argument and I straightened him out.” \\nMichael’s face was impassive when he said  to his brother, “You straightened out, \\nFreddie?” \\nFreddie stared sullenly at his younger brother. He didn’t answer. Greene laughed and \\nsaid, “The son of a bitch was taking them to  bed two at a time, the old sandwich job. \\nFreddie, I gotta admit you real ly put it to those broads. N obody else could make them \\nhappy after you got through with them.” \\nHagen saw that this had caught Michael by su rprise. They looked at each other. This \\nwas perhaps the real reason the Don wa s displeased with Freddie. The Don was \\nstraitlaced about sex. He would consider such cavorting by his son Freddie, two girls at \\na time, as degeneracy. Allowing himself to be physically humiliated by a man like Moe \\nGreene would decrease respect for the Corleone Family. That too would be part of the \\nreason for being in his father’s bad books. \\nMichael rising from his chair, said, in a tone of dismissal, “I have to get back to New \\nYork tomorrow, so think about your price.” \\nGreene said savagely, “You son of a bitch, you think you can just brush me off like that? \\nI killed more men than you befor e I could jerk off. I’ll fly to New York and talk to the Don \\nhimself. I’ll make him an offer.” \\nFreddie said nervously to Tom Hagen, “Tom, y ou’re the Consigliere, you can talk to the \\nDon and advise him.” \\nIt was then that Michael turned  the full chilly blast of his personality on the two Vegas \\nmen. “The Don has sort of semiretired,” he sa id. “I’m running the Family business now. \\nAnd I’ve removed Tom from the Consigliere s pot. He’ll be strictly my lawyer here in \\nVegas. He’ll be moving out with his family in a couple of mont hs to get all the legal work \\nstarted. So anything you have to say, say it to me.” \\nNobody answered. Michael said formally, “Fr eddie, you’re my older brother, I have \\nrespect for you. But don’t ever take sides with anybody against the Family again. I won’t \\neven mention it to the Don.” He turned to  Moe Greene. “Don’t insult people who are \\ntrying to help you. You’d do better to use your  energy to find out why the casino is losing \\nmoney. The Corleone Family has big dough invested here and we’re not getting our money’s worth, but I still didn’t come here to  abuse you. I offer a helping hand. Well, if \\nyou prefer to spit on that helping hand, that’s your business. I can’t say any more.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 330\\nHe had not once raised his voice but his words had a sobering effect on both Greene \\nand Freddie. Michael stared at bot h of them, moving away from the table to indicate that \\nhe expected them both to leav e. Hagen went to the door  and opened it. Both men left \\nwithout saying good night. \\n* * *  \\nThe next morning Michael Corleone got the message from Moe Greene: he would not \\nsell his share of the hotel at any price. It was Freddie  who delivered the message. \\nMichael shrugged and said to hi s brother, “I want to see Nino before I go back to New \\nYork.” \\nIn Nino’s suite they found Johnny Fontane si tting on the couch eating breakfast. Jules \\nwas examining Nino behind the closed drapes of the bedroom . Finally the drapes were \\ndrawn back. Michael was shocked at how Nino looked. The man was visibly \\ndisintegrating. The eyes were dazed, the mouth loose, all the muscles of his face slack. \\nMichael sat on his bedside and said, “Nino, it’s good to catch up with you. The Don \\nalways asks about you.” \\nNino grinned, it was the old gr in. “Tell him I’m dying. Tell  him show business is more \\ndangerous than the olive oil business.” \\n“You’ll be OK,” Michael said. “If there’s anything bothering yo u that the Family can help, \\njust tell me.” \\nNino shook his head. “There’s nothing,” he said. “Nothing.” \\nMichael chatted for a few more moment s and then left. Freddie accompanied him and \\nhis party to the airport, but at Michael’s request didn’t hang arou nd for departure time. \\nAs he boarded the plane with Tom Hagen and Al Neri, Michael turned to Neri and said, \\n“Did you make him good?” \\nNeri tapped his forehead. “I got Moe Greene mugged and numbered up here.” \\nChapter 28  \\nOn the plane ride back to Ne w York, Michael Corleone relaxe d and tried to sleep. It was \\nuseless. The most terrible period of his life was approaching, perhaps even a fatal time. \\nIt could no longer be put off. Everything wa s in readiness, all precautions had been \\ntaken, two years of precautions. There c ould be no further delay. Last week when the \\nDon had formally announced his retirement to  the caporegimes and other members of \\nthe Corleone Family, Michael knew  that this was his father’s way of telling him the time  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 331\\nwas ripe. \\nIt was almost three years now since he had returned home and over two years since he \\nhad married Kay. The three years had been spent in learning the Family business. He \\nhad put in long hours with Tom Hagen, long hours with the Don. He was amazed at how \\nwealthy and powerful the Corleone Family truly was. It owned tremendously valuable \\nreal estate in midtown New York, whole office buildings. It owned, through fronts, \\npartnerships in two Wall St reet brokerage houses, pieces of banks on Long Island, \\npartnerships in some garment c enter firms, all this in addition to its illegal operations in \\ngambling. \\nThe most interesting thing Michael Corl eone learned, in going back over past \\ntransactions of the Corleone Fa mily, was that the Family had received some protection \\nincome shortly after the war from a gr oup of music record counterfeiters. The \\ncounterfeiters duplicated and so ld phonograph records of famo us artists, packaging \\neverything so skillfully they were never caught. Naturally on the records they sold to \\nstores the artists and or iginal production company received not a penny. Michael \\nCorleone noticed that Johnny Fontane had lo st a lot of money owing to this \\ncounterfeiting because at that time, just before he lost his voice, his records were the most popular in the country. \\nHe asked Tom Hagen about it. Why did the Don allow the c ounterfeiters to cheat his \\ngodson? Hagen shrugged. Business was busine ss. Besides, Johnny was in the Don’s \\nbad graces, Johnny having divorced his chil dhood sweetheart to marry Margot Ashton. \\nThis had displeased the Don greatly. \\n“How come these guys stopped their operation?” Michael asked. “The cops got on to \\nthem?” \\nHagen shook his head. “The Don withdrew his protection. That  was right after Connie’s \\nwedding.” \\nIt was a pattern he was to see often, t he Don helping those in  misfortune whose \\nmisfortune he had partly created.  Not perhaps out of cunning or planning but because of \\nhis variety of interests or per haps because of the nature of t he universe, the interlinking \\nof good and evil, natural of itself. \\nMichael had married Kay up in New England, a quie t wedding, with only her family and \\na few of her friends present. Then they had moved into one of the houses on the mall in \\nLong Beach. Michael was surprised at how we ll Kay got along with his parents and the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 332\\nother people living on the mall. And of course she had gotten pregnant right away, like a \\ngood, old-style Italian wife was supposed to, and that helped. The second kid on the \\nway in two years was just icing. \\nKay would be waiting for him at the airport, she always came to meet him, she was \\nalways so glad when he came back from a tr ip. And he was too. Except now. For the \\nend of this trip meant that he finally had to  take the action he had been groomed for over \\nthe last three years. The Don would be wait ing for him. The caporegimes would be \\nwaiting for him. And he, Mic hael Corleone, would have to give the orders, make the \\ndecisions which would decide his and his Family’s fate. \\n* * *  \\nEvery morning when Kay Adams Corleone got up to take care of the baby’s early feeding, she saw Mama Corleone, the Don’s wife, being driv en away from the mall by \\none of the bodyguards, to return an hour later.  Kay soon learned that her mother-in-law \\nwent to church every single morning. Often on her return, the old woman stopped by for \\nmorning coffee and to see her new grandchild. \\nMama Corleone always started off by asking Kay why she didn’t think of becoming a \\nCatholic, ignoring the fact that Kay’s child had already been baptiz ed a Protestant. So \\nKay felt it was proper to ask the old woma n why she went to church every morning, \\nwhether that was a necessary part of being a Catholic. \\nAs if she thought that this might have stopped Kay from converting the old woman said, “Oh, no, no, some Catholics only go to church on Easter and Christmas. You go when \\nyou feel like going.” \\nKay laughed. “Then why do you go every single morning?” \\nIn a completely natural way, Mama Corleo ne said, “I go for my husband,” she pointed \\ndown toward the floor, “so he don’t go down t here.” She paused. “I say prayers for his \\nsoul every day so he go up there.” She pointed heavenward. S he said this with an \\nimpish smile, as if she were subverting her hus band’s will in some way, or as if it were a \\nlosing cause. It was said jokingly almost, in her grim, Italian, ol d crone fashion. And as \\nalways when her husband was not present, there was an attitude of disrespect to the \\ngreat Don. \\n“How is your husband feeling?” Kay asked politely. \\nMama Corleone shrugged. “He’s not the same m an since they shot him. He lets Michael  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 333\\ndo all the work, he just plays the fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes. As if he \\nwere some peasant still. But men are always like that.” \\nLater in the morning Connie  Corleone would walk across the mall with her two children \\nto pay Kay a visit and chat. Kay liked Connie, her vivaciousness, her obvious fondness \\nfor her brother Michael. Conn ie had taught Kay how to cook some Italian dishes but \\nsometimes brought her own more  expert concoctions over for Michael to taste. \\nNow this morning as she usually did, s he asked Kay what Michael thought of her \\nhusband, Carlo. Did Michael rea lly like Carlo, as he seemed to? Carlo had always had a \\nlittle trouble with the Family bu t now over the last years he had straightened out. He was \\nreally doing well in the labor union but he had to work so hard, such long hours. Carlo \\nreally liked Michael, Connie always said. But then, everybody liked Michael, just as \\neverybody liked her father. Michael was the Don all over again.  It was the best thing that \\nMichael was going to run the Family olive oil business. \\nKay had observed before that when Connie spoke about her husband in relation to the \\nFamily, she was always nervously eager for some  word of approval for Carlo. Kay would \\nhave been stupid if she had not noticed the al most terrified concern Connie had for \\nwhether Michael liked Carlo or not. One ni ght she spoke to Michael about it and \\nmentioned the fact that  nobody ever spoke about Sonny Corleone, nobody even \\nreferred to him; at least not in her pr esence. Kay had once tried to express her \\ncondolences to the Don and hi s wife and had been listened to wi th almost rude silence \\nand then ignored. She had  tried to get Connie talking about her older br other without \\nsuccess. \\nSonny’s wife, Sandra, had taken her childr en and moved to Florida, where her own \\nparents now lived. Certain financial arrangements had been m ade so that she and her \\nchildren could live comfortably,  but Sonny had left no estate. \\nMichael reluctantly explained what had happened the night Sonny was killed. That Carlo \\nhad beaten his wife and Connie had called t he mall and Sonny had taken the call and \\nrushed out in a blind rage. So naturally Co nnie and Carlo were al ways nervous that the \\nrest of the Family blamed her for indirectly causing Sonny’s death. Or blamed her \\nhusband, Carlo. But this wasn’t the case. T he proof was that they had given Connie and \\nCarlo a house in the mall itself and promoted Carlo to an impor tant job in the labor union \\nsetup. And Carlo had straightened out, stopped drinking, stopped whoring, stopped \\ntrying to be a wise guy. The Family was pleas ed with his work and attitude for the last  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 334\\ntwo years. Nobody blamed him for what had happened. \\n“Then why don’t you invite them over some ev ening and you can reassure your sister?” \\nKay said. “The poor thing is always so nerv ous about what you think of her husband. \\nTell her. And tell her to put thos e silly worries out of her head.” \\n“I can’t do that,” Michael said. “We don’t talk about those things in our family.” \\n“Do you want me to tell her w hat you’ve told me?” Kay said. \\nShe was puzzled because he took such a long ti me thinking over a suggestion that was \\nobviously the proper thing to do. Finally he sa id, “I don’t think you should, Kay. I don’t \\nthink it will do any good. She’ll worry anyway. It’s something nobody can do anything \\nabout.” \\nKay was amazed. She realized that Michael was always a little colder to his sister \\nConnie than he was to anyone else, despite C onnie’s affection. “Surely you don’t blame \\nConnie for Sonny being killed?” she said. \\nMichael sighed. “Of course not,”  he said. “She’s my kid sister  and I’m very fo nd of her. I \\nfeel sorry for her. Carlo straightened out, but he’s really the wrong kind of husband. It’s \\njust one of those things. Let’s forget about it.” \\nIt was not in Kay’s nature to nag; she let it drop. Also she had learned that Michael was not a man to push, that he could become coldly disagreeable. She knew she was the \\nonly person in the wo rld who could bend hi s will, but she also knew that to do it too often \\nwould be to destroy that power. And living with him the last two years had made her love \\nhim more. \\nShe loved him because he was always fair. An  odd thing. But he always was fair to \\neverybody around him, never ar bitrary even in little things . She had observed that he \\nwas now a very powerful man, people came to the house to confer with him and ask \\nfavors, treating him with deference and resp ect but one thing had endeared him to her \\nabove everything else. \\nEver since Michael had come back from Sicily with his broken face, everybody in the \\nFamily had tried to get him to undergo correct ive surgery. Michael’s mother was after \\nhim constantly; one Sunday di nner with all the Corleones gathered on the mall she \\nshouted at Michael, “You look like a gangster in the movies, get your face fixed for the \\nsake of Jesus Christ and y our poor wife. And so your nose will stop running like a \\ndrunken Irish.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 335\\nThe Don, at the head of the t able, watching everything, said  to Kay, “Does it bother \\nyou?” \\nKay shook her head. The Don said  to his wife. “He’s out of  your hands, it’s no concern \\nof yours.” The old woman i mmediately held her peace. No t that she feared her husband \\nbut because it would have been disrespectful to dispute him in such a matter before the \\nothers. \\nBut Connie, the Don’s favorite, came in fr om the kitchen, where she was cooking the \\nSunday dinner, her face flushed from the stove, and said, “I think he should get his face \\nfixed. He was the most handsome one in the family before he got hurt. Come on, Mike, \\nsay you’ll do it.” \\nMichael looked at her in an absentminded fashion. It seemed as  if he really and truly \\nhad not heard anything said. He didn’t answer. \\nConnie came to stand beside her father. “Mak e him do it,” she said to the Don. Her two \\nhands rested affectionately on his shoulders and she rubbed his neck. She was the only \\none who was ever so familiar with the Don. He r affection for her father was touching. It \\nwas trusting, like a little girl’s. The Don patted one of her hands and said, “We’re all \\nstarving here. Put the spaghetti on the table and then chatter.” \\nConnie turned to her husband and said, “Carlo, you tell Mike to get his face fixed. \\nMaybe he’ll listen to you.” Her voice impl ied that Michael and Carlo Rizzi had some \\nfriendly relationship over and above anyone else’s. \\nCarlo, handsomely sunburned, blond hair neatly cut and combed, sipped at his glass of \\nhomemade wine and said, “Nobody can tell Mi ke what to do.” Carlo had become a \\ndifferent man since moving into the mall. He k new his place in the Family and kept to it. \\nThere was something that Kay didn’t understand in all this, something that didn’t quite \\nmeet the eye. As a woman she could see t hat Connie was deliberately charming her \\nfather, though it was beautifully done and even sincere. Ye t it was not spontaneous. \\nCarlo’s reply had been a manly knuckling of his forehead. Michael had absolutely \\nignored everything. \\nKay didn’t care about her husband’s disfi gurement but she worri ed about his sinus \\ntrouble which sprang from it. Surgery repair of  the face would cure the sinus also. For \\nthat reason she wanted Michael to enter th e hospital and get the necessary work done. \\nBut she understood that in a curious way he desired his disfigurement. She was sure \\nthat the Don understood this too.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 336\\nBut after Kay gave birth to her first child, she was surprised by Michael asking her, “Do \\nyou want me to get  my face fixed?” \\nKay nodded. “You know how kids  are, your son will feel bad about your face when he \\ngets old enough to understand it’s not  normal. I just don’t want our child to see it. I don’t \\nmind at all, honestly, Michael.” \\n“OK.” He smiled at her. “I’ll do it.” \\nHe waited until she was ho me from the hospital and t hen made all the necessary \\narrangements. The operation was successful. The cheek indentation was now just \\nbarely noticeable. \\nEverybody in the Family wa s delighted, but Connie more so than anyone. She visited \\nMichael every day in the hospital, dragging Carlo along. When Michael came home, she \\ngave him a big hug and a kiss and looked at him admiringly and said, “Now you’re my \\nhandsome brother again.” \\nOnly the Don was unimpressed, shrugging hi s shoulders and remarking, “What’s the \\ndifference?” \\nBut Kay was grateful. She knew that Michael had do ne it against all hi s own inclinations. \\nHad done it because she had asked him to, and that she was the only person in the \\nworld who could make him act against his own nature. \\n \\n* * *  \\nOn the afternoon of Michael’s return from Vegas, Rocco Lampone drove the limousine \\nto the mall to pick up Kay so that she coul d meet her husband at the airport. She always \\nmet her husband when he arrived from out of  town, mostly because she felt lonely \\nwithout him, living as she di d in the fortified mall. \\nShe saw him come off the plane with Tom Hagen and the new man he had working for \\nhim, Albert Neri. Kay didn’t care much for Neri, he reminded her of Luca Brasi in his \\nquiet ferociousness. She saw Neri drop behi nd Michael and off to the side, saw his \\nquick penetrating glance as his eyes swept ov er everybody nearby. It was Neri who first \\nspotted Kay and touched Michael’s shoulder to make him look in the proper direction. \\nKay ran into her husband’s arms and he quickl y kissed her and let her go. He and Tom \\nHagen and Kay got into the limousine and Albert Neri vanish ed. Kay did not notice that \\nNeri had gotten into another ca r with two other men and that this car rode behind the  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 337\\nlimousine until it reached Long Beach. \\nKay never asked Michael how his business had gone. Even such polite questions were \\nunderstood to be awkward, not t hat he wouldn’t give her an eq ually polite answer, but it \\nwould remind them both of the forbidden te rritory their marriage could never include. \\nKay didn’t mind anymore. But when Michael told her he would have to spend the \\nevening with his father to tell him about the V egas trip, she couldn’t help making a little \\nfrown of disappointment. \\n“I’m sorry,” Michael said. “Tomorrow night we’ll go into New York and see a show and \\nhave dinner, OK?” He patted her stomach,  she was almost seven months pregnant. \\n“After the kid comes you’ll be tied down again. Hell, you’re more Italian than Yankee. \\nTwo kids in two years.” \\nKay said tartly, “And you’re more Yankee t han Italian. Your first evening home and you \\nspend it on business.” But she smiled at him when she said it. “You won’t be home \\nlate?” \\n“Before midnight,” Michael said. “Don’t wait up for me if you feel tired.” \\n“I’ll wait up,” Kay said. \\n* * *  \\nAt the meeting that night, in the corner room library of D on Corleone’s house, were the \\nDon himself, Michael, Tom Hagen, Carlo Rizzi, and the two caporegimes, Clemenza \\nand Tessio. \\nThe atmosphere of the meeti ng was by no means so congenia l as in former days. Ever \\nsince Don Corleone h ad announced his semiretirement and Michael’s take-over of the \\nFamily business, ther e had been some strain. Successi on in control of such an \\nenterprise as the Family was by no means hereditary. In any other Family powerful \\ncaporegimes such as Clemenza and Tessio might have succeeded to the position of \\nDon. Or at least they might have been allow ed to split off and form their own Family. \\nThen, too, ever since Don Corleone had m ade the peace with the Five Families, the \\nstrength of the Corleone Family  had declined. The Ba rzini Family was now indisputably \\nthe most powerful one in the New York area; allied as they were to the Tattaglias, they \\nnow held the position the Corleone Family had onc e held. Also they were slyly whittling \\ndown the power of the Corleone Family, muscli ng into their gambling areas, testing the \\nCorleones’ reactions and, finding them weak , establishing their own bookmakers.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 338\\nThe Barzinis and Tattaglias were delight ed with the Don’s retirement. Michael, \\nformidable as he might prove to be, could never hope to equal the Don in cunning and \\ninfluence for at least another decade. The Co rleone Family was definitely in a decline. \\nIt had, of course, suffered serious misfortu nes. Freddie had proved to be nothing more \\nthan an innkeeper and ladies’ m an, the idiom for ladies’ man untranslatable but \\nconnotating a greedy infant al ways at its mother’s nipple– in short, unmanly. Sonny’s \\ndeath too, had been a disaster. Sonny had been a man to be feared, not to be taken \\nlightly. Of course he had made a mistake in s ending his younger brother, Michael, to kill \\nthe Turk and the police captain. Though necessa ry in a tactical sense, as a long-term \\nstrategy it proved to be a serious error. It had forced the Don, eventually, to rise from his \\nsickbed. It had deprived Michael of two years of valuable experience and training under \\nhis father’s tutelage. And of course an Irish as a Consigliere had been the only \\nfoolishness the Don had ever per petrated. No Irishman could hope to equal a Sicilian for \\ncunning. So went the opinion of all the Famili es and they were naturally more respectful \\nto the Barzini-Tattaglia alliance than to the Corleones. Their opinion of Michael was that \\nhe was not equal to Sonny in force though more intelligent certainly, but not as \\nintelligent as his father. A mediocre su ccessor and a man not to be feared too greatly. \\nAlso, though the Don was generally admired fo r his statesmanship in making the peace, \\nthe fact that he had not avenged S onny’s murder lost the Family  a great deal of respect. \\nIt was recognized that such states manship sprang out of weakness. \\nAll this was known to the men sitting in t he room and perhaps even believed by a few. \\nCarlo Rizzi liked Michael but did not fear him as he had feared Sonny. Clemenza, too, though he gave Michael credit for a bravura performance with the Turk and the police \\ncaptain, could not help thinki ng Michael too soft to be a Don.  Clemenza had hoped to be \\nglven permission to form his own Family, to have his own empire split away from the \\nCorleone. But the Don had indi cated that this was not to be and Clemenza respected \\nthe Don too much to disobey. Unless of course  the whole situation became intolerable. \\nTessio had a better opinion of Michael. He sensed something else in the young man: a \\nforce cleverly kept hidden, a man jealously  guarding his true str ength from public gaze, \\nfollowing the Don’s precept that a friend s hould always underestimate your virtues and \\nan enemy overestimate your faults. \\nThe Don himself and Tom Hagen were of course under no illusions about Michael. The \\nDon would never have retired if he had not had absolute faith in hi s son’s ability to  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 339\\nretrieve the Family position. Hagen had been Michael’s teacher for the last two years \\nand was amazed at how quickly Michael grasped all the intricacies of the Family \\nbusiness. Truly his father’s son. \\nClemenza and Tessio were annoyed with Michael  because he had reduced the strength \\nof their regimes and had never reconstituted Sonny’s regime. The Corleone Family, in \\neffect, had now only two fighting divisions  with less personnel than formerly. Clemenza \\nand Tessio considered this suicidal, especially with the Barzini-Ta ttaglia encroachments \\non their empires. So now they were hopeful these errors might be corrected at this \\nextraordinary meeting convened by the Don. \\nMichael started off by telling them about hi s trip to Vegas and Moe Greene’s refusing \\nthe offer to buy him out. “But we’ll make hi m an offer he can’t refuse ,” Michael said. “You \\nalready know the Corleone Family plans to mo ve its operations Wes t. We’ll have four of \\nthe hotel casinos on the Strip. But it can’ t be right away. We need time to get things \\nstraightened out.” He spoke directly to Clem enza. “Pete, you and Tessio, I want you to \\ngo along with me for a year without questioni ng and without reservations. At the end of \\nthat year, both of you can split off from th e Corleone Family an d be your own bosses, \\nhave your own Families. Of cour se it goes without saying we’d maintain our friendship, I \\nwouldn’t insult you and your respect for my father by thinking otherwise for a minute. But up until that time l want you just to follow my lead and don’t worry. There are \\nnegotiations going on that will so lve problems that you think are not solvable. So just be \\na little patient.” \\nTessio spoke up. “If Moe Greene wanted to talk to your father, why not let him? The Don \\ncould always persuade anybody, there was nev er anyone who could stand up to his \\nreasonableness.” \\nThe Don answered this directly. “I’ve retired, Michael would lo se respect if I interfered. \\nAnd besides that’s a man I’ d rather not talk to.” \\nTessio remembered the stories he’d h eard about Moe Greene slapping Freddie \\nCorleone around one night in the Vegas hotel. He began to smell a rat. He leaned back. \\nMoe Greene was a dead man, he thought. The Corleone Family did not wish to persuade him. \\nCarlo Rizzi spoke up. “Is t he Corleone Family going to stop operating in New York \\naltogether?” \\nMichael nodded. “We’re selling the olive oil business. Everything we can, we turn over to  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 340\\nTessio and Clemenza. But, Carlo, I don’t want you to worry about your job. You grew up \\nin Nevada, you know the st ate, you know the people. I’m counting on you being my \\nright-hand man when we make our move out there.” \\nCarlo leaned back, his face flushed with gratification. His  time was coming, he would \\nmove in the constellations of power. \\nMichael went on. “Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere. He’s going to be our lawyer \\nin Vegas. In about two months he’ll move ou t there permanently with his family. Strictly \\nas a lawyer. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. He’s a \\nlawyer and that’s all. No reflection on Tom. That’s the way I want it. Besides, if I ever \\nneed any advice, who’s a better counselor than my father?” They all laughed. But they had gotten the message despite the joke. To m Hagen was out; he no longer held any \\npower. They all took their fleeting glances to  check Hagen’s reaction but his face was \\nimpassive. \\nClemenza spoke up in his fat man’s wheeze. “T hen in a year’s time we’re on our own, is \\nthat it?” \\n“Maybe less,” Michael said courteously. “Of course you can always remain part of the Family, that’s your choice. But most of our  strength will be out West and maybe you’d do \\nbetter organized on your own.” \\nTessio said quietly, “In that case I think y ou should give us permission to recruit new \\nmen for our regimes. Those Barzini bastards k eep chiseling in on my territory. I think \\nmaybe it would be wise to teach them a little lesson in manners.” \\nMichael shook his head. “No. No  good. Just stay still. All that stuff will be negotiated, \\neverything will be straight ened out before we leave.” \\nTessio was not to be so easily satisfied. He spoke to the Don directly, taking a chance on incurring Michael’s ill will. “Forgive me, G odfather, let our years of friendship be my \\nexcuse. But I think you and your son are a ll wrong with this Nevada business. How can \\nyou hope for success there without your strength here to back you up? The two go hand \\nin hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tatt aglia will be too strong for \\nus. Me and Pete will have trouble, we’ll co me under their thumb sooner or later. And \\nBarzini is a man not to my taste. I say the Corleone Family has to make its move from \\nstrength, not from weakness. We should bu ild up our regimes and take back our lost \\nterritories in Staten Island at least.” \\nThe Don shook his head. “I made the peace, remember, I can’t go back on my word.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 341\\nTessio refused to be silenced. “Everybody knows Bartini gave you provocation since \\nthen. And besides, if Michael is the new chie f of the Corleone Family, what’s to stop him \\nfrom taking any action he sees fit? Your word doesn’t strictly bind him.” \\nMichael broke in sharply. He said to Tessio,  very much the chief now, “There are things \\nbeing negotiated which will answer your questions  and resolve your doubts. If my word \\nisn’t enough for you, ask your Don.” \\nBut Tessio understood he had fina lly gone too far. If he dar ed to question the Don he \\nwould make Michael, his enemy. So he shr ugged and said, “I spoke for the good of the \\nFamily, not for myself. I c an take care of myself.” \\nMichael gave him a friendly smile. “Tessio,  I never doubt you in any way. I never did. \\nBut trust in me. Of course I’m not equal to y ou and Pete in these things, but after all I’ve \\nmy father to guide me. I won’t do t oo badly, we’ll all come out fine.” \\nThe meeting was over. The big news was th at Clemenza and Tessio would be permitted \\nto form their own Families from their regi mes. Tessio would have his gambling and \\ndocks in Brooklyn, Clemenza t he gambling in Manhattan and the Family contacts in the \\nracing tracks of Long Island. \\nThe two caporegimes left not quite satisfied, still a little uneasy. Carlo Rizzi lingered \\nhoping that the time had come when he finally would be treated as one of the family, but \\nhe quickly saw that Michael was not of t hat mind. He left the Don, Tom Hagen and \\nMichael alone in the corner library room. Albert Neri us hered him out of the house and \\nCarlo noticed that Neri stood in the doorway watching him walk across the floodlit mall. \\nIn the library the three men had relax ed as only people can who have lived years \\ntogether in the same house, in the same fam ily. Michael served some anisette to the \\nDon and scotch to Tom Hagen. He took a dr ink for himself, which he rarely did. \\nTom Hagen spoke up first. “Mike, why ar e you cutting me out of the action?” \\nMichael seemed surprised. “You’ll be my number one man in Vegas. We’ll be legitimate \\nall the way and you’re the legal man. W hat can be more impor tant than that?” \\nHagen smiled a little sadly. “I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about Rocco Lampone \\nbuilding a secret regime without my knowledge.  I’m talking about yo u dealing direct with \\nNeri rather than through me or a caporegime . Unless of course you don’t know what \\nLampone’s doing.” \\nMichael said softly, “How did you find out about Lampone’s regime?”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 342\\nHagen shrugged. “Don’t worry, there’s no leak, nobody else knows. But in my position I \\ncan see what’s happening. You gave Lampone his own living , you gave him a lot of \\nfreedom. So he needs people to help him in his li ttle empire. But everybody he recruits \\nhas to be reported to me. And I notice ever ybody he puts on the payroll is a little too \\ngood for that particular job, is getting a little more money than that particular exercise is \\nworth. You picked the right man when you picked Lampone, by the way. He’s operating \\nperfectly.” \\nMichael grimaced. “Not so damn perfect if you noticed. Anyway the Don picked \\nLampone.” \\n“OK,” Tom said, “so why am I cut out of the action?” \\nMichael faced him and without flinching gave it to him st raight. “Tom, you’re not a \\nwartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with this move we ’re trying to make and we \\nmay have to fight. And I want to get you out of the line of fire too, just in case.” \\nHagen’s face reddened. If the Don had told him the same thing, he would have accepted it humbly. But where the hell di d Mike come off making such a snap \\njudgment? \\n“OK,” he said, “but I happen to  agree with Tessio. I think you’re going about this all \\nwrong. You’re making the move out of w eakness, not strength. That’s always bad. \\nBarzini is like a wolf, and if he tears you limb from limb, t he other Families won’t come \\nrushing to help the Corleones.” \\nThe Don finally spoke. “Tom, it ’s not just Michael. I advised him on these matters. There \\nare things that may have to be done that I don’t want in any way to be responsible for. \\nThat is my wish, not Michael’s. I never t hought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought \\nSantino a bad Don, may his soul rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn’t the \\nright man to head the Family when I had my  little misfortune. And who would have \\nthought that Fredo would become a lackey of women? So don’t feel badly. Michael has \\nall my confidence as you do. For reasons wh ich you can’t know, you must have no part \\nin what may happen. By the way, I told Michael  that Lampone’s secret regime would not \\nescape your eye. So that shows I have faith in you.” \\nMichael laughed. “I honestly didn’t  think you’d pick that up, Tom.” \\nHagen knew he was being mollified. “Maybe I can help,” he said. \\nMichael shook his head decisively. “You’re out, Tom.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 343\\nTom finished his drink and befor e he left he gave Michael a mild reproof. “You’re nearly \\nas good as your father,” he told Michael. “B ut there’s one thing you still have to learn.” \\n“What’s that?” Michael said politely. \\n“How to say no,” Hagen answered. \\nMichael nodded gravely. “You’re righ t,” he said. “I’ll remember that.” \\nWhen Hagen had left, Michael said jokingly to his father, “So you’ve taught me \\neverything else. Tell me how to say no to people in a way they’ll like.” \\nThe Don moved to sit behind the big desk. “You cannot say ‘no’ to the people you love, \\nnot often. That’s the secret. And then when yo u do, it has to sound like a ‘yes.’ Or you \\nhave to make them say ‘no.’ You have to take time and trouble. But I’m old-fashioned, \\nyou’re the new modern generat ion, don’t listen to me.” \\nMichael laughed. “Right. You agree about  Tom being out, though, don’t you?” \\nThe Don nodded. “He can’t be involved in this.” \\nMichael said quietly, “I think it’s time for me  to tell you that what I’m going to do is not \\npurely out of vengeance for Apollonia and S onny. It’s the right thing to do. Tessio and \\nTom are right about the Barzinis.” \\nDon Corleone nodded. “Rev enge is a dish that tastes best when it is cold,” he said. “I \\nwould not have made that peac e but that I knew you would never come home alive \\notherwise. I’m surprised, though, that Barzini still made a last try at  you. Maybe it was \\narranged before the peace talk and he couldn’t stop it. Are you sure they were not after \\nDon Tommasino?” \\nMichael said, “That’s the way it was supposed to look. And it would have been perfect, even you would never have suspected. Except that I came out alive. I saw Fabrizzio \\ngoing through the gate, running away. And of course I’ve checked it all out since I’ve been back.” \\n“Have they found that s hepherd?” the Don asked. \\n“I found him,” Michael said. “I found him a year ago. He’s got his own little pizza place up in Buffalo. New name, phony  passport and identification. He’s doing very well is \\nFabrizzio the shepherd.” \\nThe Don nodded. “So it’s to no purpose to  wait any longer. W hen will you start?” \\nMichael said, “I want to wait until after Kay has the baby. Just in case anything goes  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 344\\nwrong. And I want Tom settled in Vegas so he w on’t be concerned in the affair. I think a \\nyear from now.” \\n“You’ve prepared for everything?” the Don asked. He did not look at Michael when he \\nsaid this. \\nMichael said gently, “You have no part. You’re not responsible. I take all responsibility. I \\nwould refuse to let you even veto. If you tried to do that now, I w ould leave the Family \\nand go my own way. You’ re not responsible.” \\nThe Don was silent for a long time and then he sighed. He said, “So be it. Maybe that’s \\nwhy I retired, maybe that’s why I’ve turned everything over to you. I’ve done my share in \\nlife, I haven’t got the heart anymore. And there are some dut ies the best of men can’t \\nassume. That’s it then.” \\nDuring that year Kay Adams Corleone was de livered of a second child, another boy. \\nShe delivered easily, without an y trouble whatsoever, and was welcomed back to the \\nmall like a royal princess. Connie Corleo ne presented the baby with a silk layette \\nhandmade in Italy, enormously ex pensive and beautiful. She to ld Kay, “Carlo found it. \\nHe shopped all over New York to get some thing extra special after I couldn’t find \\nanything I really liked.” Kay smiled her t hanks, understood immediately that she was to \\ntell Michael this fine tale. She was on her way to becoming a Sicilian. \\nAlso during that year, Nino Valenti died of  a cerebral hemorrhage. His death made the \\nfront pages of the tabloids because the movie Johnny Font ane had featured him in had \\nopened a few weeks before and was a smash hit, establishing Nino as a major star. The \\npapers mentioned that Johnny Fontane was handli ng the funeral arr angements, that the \\nfuneral would be private, only family and close friends to attend. One sensational story \\neven claimed that in an interview Johnny F ontane had blamed himself for his friend’s \\ndeath, that he should have forced his friend to place himself under medical care, but the reporter made it sound like the usual self -reproach of the sensitive but innocent \\nbystander to a tragedy. Johnny  Fontane had made his childhood friend, Nino Valenti, a \\nmovie star and what more could a friend do? \\nNo member of the Corleone Fa mily attended the California funeral except  Freddie. Lucy \\nand Jules Segal attended. The Don himself had wanted to go to California but had \\nsuffered a slight heart attack, which kept hi m in his bed for a month. He sent a huge \\nfloral wreath instead. Albert Neri  was also sent West as the o fficial representative of the \\nFamily.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 345\\nTwo days after Nino’s funeral, Moe Greene was shot to death in th e Hollywood home of \\nhis movie-star mistress; Albert Neri did no t reappear in New York until almost a month \\nlater. He had taken his vacation in the Caribbean and returned to duty tanned almost \\nblack. Michael Corleone welcomed him with a smile and a few words of praise, which \\nincluded the information that Neri would fr om then on receive an extra “living,” the \\nFamily income from an East Side “book” considered especiall y rich. Neri was content, \\nsatisfied that he lived in a world that properly rewarded a man who did his duty. \\nBook Eight  \\nChapter 29 \\nMichael Corleone had taken precautions agains t every eventuality. His planning was \\nfaultless, his security impeccable. He was pa tient, hoping to use the full year to prepare. \\nBut he was not to get his necessary year bec ause fate itself took a stand against him, \\nand in the most surprising fash ion. For it was the Godfather, the great Don himself, who \\nfailed Michael Corleone. \\n* * *  \\nOn one sunny Sunday morning, while the women were at church, Don Vito Corleone \\ndressed in his gardening uni form: baggy gray trousers, a faded blue shirt, battered \\ndirty-brown fedora decorated by a stained gray silk hatband. The Don had gained considerable weight in his few years and worked on his tomato vines, he said, for the \\nsake of his health. But he deceived no one. \\nThe truth was, he loved tending his garden; he loved the sight of  it early on a morning. It \\nbrought back his childhood in Si cily sixty years ago, brought it back without the terror, \\nthe sorrow of his own father’s death. Now the beans in their rows grew little white flowers on top; strong green st alks of scallion fenced everythi ng in. At the foot of the \\ngarden a spouted barrel stood guard. It was fill ed with liquidy cow manure, the finest \\ngarden fertilizer. Also in that lower part of the garden were the square wooden frames he had built with his own hands, the sticks cross-tied with thick white string. Over these \\nframes crawled the tomato vines. \\nThe Don hastened to water his garden. It mu st be done before the sun waxed too hot \\nand turned the water into a prism of fire that  could burn his lettuce leaves like paper. \\nSun was more important than water, water al so was important; but the two, imprudently \\nmixed, could cause great misfortune.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 346\\nThe Don moved through his gar den hunting for ants. If ants we re present, it meant that \\nlice were in his vegetables and the ants were going afte r the lice and he would have to \\nspray. \\nHe had watered just in time. The s un was becoming hot and the Don thought, \\n“Prudence. Prudence.” But there we re just a few more plants to be supported by sticks \\nand he bent down again. He would go back in to the house when he finished this last \\nrow. \\nQuite suddenly it felt as if the sun had come down very close to his head. The air filled \\nwith dancing golden specks. Michael’s oldest boy came running through the garden \\ntoward where the Don knelt and the boy was enveloped by a yellow sh ield of blinding \\nlight. But the Don was not to be tricked, he was too old a hand. D eath hid behind that \\nflaming yellow shield ready to pounce out on him and the Don with a wave of his hand \\nwarned the boy away from his presence. Ju st in time. The sledgehammer blow inside \\nhis chest made him choke for air. T he Don pitched forward into the earth. \\nThe boy raced away to call his father. Michael Corleone and some men at the mall gate \\nran to the garden and found the Don lying prone, clutching h andfuls of earth. They lifted \\nthe Don up and carried him to the shade of his stone-flagged patio. Michael knelt beside \\nhis father, holding his hand, while the other  men called for an ambulance and doctor. \\nWith a great effort the Don opened his eyes  to see his son once  more. The massive \\nheart attack had turned his ruddy face almost blue. He was in extremis. He smelled the \\ngarden, the yellow shield of light smote his eyes, and he whispered, “Life is so \\nbeautiful.” \\nHe was spared the sight of his women’s t ears, dying before they came back from \\nchurch, dying before the ambulance arrived, or the doctor. He died surrounded by men, \\nholding the hand of the son he had most loved. \\nThe funeral was royal. The Five Families sent their Dons and caporegimes, as did the \\nTessio and Clemenza Familie s. Johnny Fontane made th e tabloid headlines by \\nattending the funeral despite the advice of Michael not to appear. Fontane gave a \\nstatement to the newspapers that Vito Co rleone was his Godfather and the finest man \\nhe had ever known and that he was honored to be permitted to pay his last respects to \\nsuch a man and didn’t give a damn who knew it. \\nThe wake was held in the house of the ma ll, in the old-fashi oned style. Amerigo \\nBonasera had never done finer work, had dischar ged all obligations, by preparing his  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 347\\nold friend and Godfather as lo vingly as a mother prepares  a bride for her wedding. \\nEveryone commented on how not even death itse lf had been able to erase the nobility \\nand the dignity of the great Don’s countenance and such remarks made Amerigo \\nBonasera fill with knowing pride,  a curious sense of power. Only he knew what a terrible \\nmassacre death had perpetrat ed on the Don’s appearance. \\nAll the old friends and servitors came. Nazo rine, his wife, his daughter and her husband \\nand their children, Lucy Mancin i came with Freddie from Las  Vegas. Tom Hagen and his \\nwife and children, the Dons from San Fr ancisco and Los Ange les, Boston and \\nCleveland. Rocco Lampone and Albert Neri were pallbearer s with Clemenza and Tessio \\nand, of course, the sons of the Don. The mall and all its hous es were filled with floral \\nwreaths. \\nOutside the gates of the mall were t he newspapermen and phot ographers and a small \\ntruck that was known to contain FBI men wit h their movie cameras recording this epic. \\nSome newspapermen who tried to crash the funeral inside found that the gate and fence \\nwere manned with security guards who dem anded identification and an invitation card. \\nAnd though they were treated wit h the utmost courtesy, refreshment sent out to them, \\nthey were not permitted inside. They tried to  speak with some of the people coming out \\nbut were met with stony stares and not a syllable. \\nMichael Corleone spent most of the day in t he corner library room with Kay, Tom Hagen \\nand Freddie. People were ushered in to see hi m, to offer their condolences. Michael \\nreceived them with all courtesy even when some of them addressed him as Godfather or Don Michael, only Kay noticing his lips tighten with displeasure. \\nClemenza and Tessio came to join this inner circle and Michael personally served them \\nwith a drink. There was some gossip of business. Michael in formed them that the mall \\nand all its houses were to be sold to a dev elopment and construction company. At an \\nenormous profit, still another proof of the great Don’s genius. \\nThey all understood that now t he whole empire would be in the West. That the Corleone \\nFamily would liquidate its power in Ne w York. Such action had been awaiting the \\nretirement or deat h of the Don. \\nIt was nearly ten years since there had been such  a celebration of people in this house, \\nnearly ten years since the we dding of Constanzia Corl eone and Carlo Rizzi, so \\nsomebody said. Michael walked to the window that looked out on t he garden. That long \\ntime ago he had sat in the garden with Kay never  dreaming that so curious a destiny  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 348\\nwas to be his. And his father dying had said, “Life is so beautiful.” Michael could never \\nremember his father ever hav ing uttered a word about death,  as if the Don respected \\ndeath too much to philosophize about it. \\nIt was time for the cemetery. It was time to bury the great  Don. Michael linked his arm \\nwith Kay’s and went out into the garden to join  the host of mourners. Behind him came \\nthe caporegimes followed by their soldiers and then all the humble people the Godfather \\nhad blessed during his lifetime.  The baker Nazorine, the widow Colombo and her sons \\nand all the countless others of his world he had ruled so firmly but justly. There were \\neven some who had been his enemies, come to do him honor. \\nMichael observed all this with a tight, polit e smile. He was not impressed. Yet, he \\nthought, if I can die saying, “Life is so beautif ul,” then nothing else is important. If I can \\nbelieve in myself that much, nothing else matters. He would follow his father. He would \\ncare for his children, his family, his world.  But his children would grow in a different \\nworld. They would be doctors, artists, scientis ts. Governors. President s. Anything at all. \\nHe would see to it that they joined the gene ral family of humanity, but he, as a powerful \\nand prudent parent would most certainly keep a wary eye on that general family. \\n* * *  \\nOn the morning after the funeral, all the most  important officials of the Corleone Family \\nassembled on the mall. Shortly before noon they  were admitted into the empty house of \\nthe Don. Michael Corleone received them. \\nThey almost filled the corner library room . There were the two caporegimes, Clemenza \\nand Tessio; Rocco Lampone, with his reasonable, competent air; Carlo Rizzi, very quiet, \\nvery much knowing his place; Tom Hagen forsak ing his strictly legal role to rally around \\nin this crisis; Albert Neri trying to stay physically close to Michael, lighting his new Don’s \\ncigarette, mixing his drink, all to show an unswerving loyalty despite the recent disaster \\nto the Corleone Family. \\nThe death of the Don was a grea t misfortune for the Family. Without him it seemed that \\nhalf their strength was gone and almost all their bargaining power against the \\nBarzini-Tattaglia alliance. Everyone in the room knew this and they waited for what \\nMichael would say. In their eyes he wa s not yet the new Don; he had not earned the \\nposition or the title. If the Godfather had lived, he might have assured his son’s \\nsuccession; now it was by no means certain. \\nMichael waited until Ned had served drinks. T hen he said quietly, “I just want to tell  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 349\\neverybody here that I understand how they feel. I know y ou all respected my father, but \\nnow you have to worry about yourselves and your families. Some of you wonder how \\nwhat happened is going to a ffect the planning we’ve done and the promises I made. \\nWell, the answer to that is: nothi ng. Everything goes on as before.” \\nClemenza shook his great shaggy buffalo head. His hair was an iron gray and his \\nfeatures, more deeply embedded in added layers of fat, were unpleasant. “The Barzinis \\nand Tattaglias are going to move in on us r eal hard, Mike. You gotta fight or have a \\n‘sit-down’ with them.” Ever yone in the room noticed t hat Clemenza had not used a \\nformal form of address to Michael, much less the title of Don. \\n“Let’s wait and see what happens ,” Michael said. “Let th em break the peace first.” \\nTessio spoke up in his soft voice. “They already have, Mike. They opened up two \\n‘books’ in Brooklyn this morning. I got the word from the police captain who runs the \\nprotection list at the station house. In a month I won’t have a place to hang my hat in all \\nBrooklyn.” \\nMichael stared at him thoughtfully. “Have you done anything about it?” \\nTessio shook his small, ferretlike head. “No,” he said. “I didn’t want to give you any \\nproblems.” \\n“Good,” Michael said. “Just sit ti ght. And I guess that’s what I w ant to say to all of you. \\nJust sit tight. Don’t re act to any provocation. Give me a few weeks to straighten things \\nout, to see which way the wind is going to blow. Then I’ll make the best deal I can for \\neverybody here. Then we’ll have a final meeting and make some final decisions.” \\nHe ignored their surprise and Albert Neri started ushering them  out. Michael said \\nsharply, “Tom, stick around a few minutes.” \\nHagen went to the window that faced the ma ll. He waited until he saw the caporegimes \\nand Carlo Rizzo and Rocco Lampone being shepherded through the guarded gate by \\nNeri. Then he turned to Michael and said, “Have you got all the political connections \\nwired into you?” \\nMichael shook his head regretfully. “Not a ll. I needed about four more months. The Don \\nand I were working on it. But I’ve got all t he judges, we did that fi rst, and some of the \\nmore important people in Congress. And the big party boys here in New York were no \\nproblem, of course. The Corleone Family is a lot stronger than anybody thinks, but I \\nhoped to make it foolproof.” He smiled at H agen. “I guess you’ve figured everything out  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 350\\nby now.” \\nHagen nodded. “It wasn’t hard. Except why you wanted me out of the action. But I put \\non my Sicilian hat and I fi nally figured that too.” \\nMichael laughed. “The old man said you would.  But that’s a luxury I can’t afford \\nanymore. I need you here. At least for the next few weeks. You better phone Vegas and \\ntalk to your wife. Just tell her a few weeks.” \\nHagen said musingly, “How do you think they’ll come at you?” \\nMichael sighed. “The Don instructed me. Th rough somebody close. Brazini will set me \\nup through somebody close that, supposedly, I won’t suspect.” \\nHagen smiled at him. “Somebody like me.” \\nMichael smiled back. “You’re Irish, they won’t trust you.” \\n“I’m German-American,” Hagen said. \\n“To them that’s Irish,” Michael said. “They won’t go to you and they won’t go to Neri \\nbecause Neri was a cop. Plus both of you ar e too close to me. They can’t take that \\ngamble. Rocco Lampone isn’t close enough. No , it will be Clemenza, Tessio or Carlo \\nRizzi.” \\nHagen said softly, “I’m  betting it’s Carlo.” \\n“We’ll see,” Michael said. “It won’t be long.” \\n* * *  \\nIt was the next morning, wh ile Hagen and Michael were  having breakfast together. \\nMichael took a phone call in the library, and  when he came back to the kitchen, he said \\nto Hagen, “It’s all set up. I’m going to meet  Barzini a week from now. To make new \\npeace now that the Don is  dead.” Michael laughed. \\nHagen asked, “Who phoned you, who made the c ontact?” They both knew that whoever \\nin the Corleone Family had made the contact had turned traitor. \\nMichael gave Hagen a sad regretful smile. “Tessio,” he said. \\nThey ate the rest of their breakfast in si lence. Over coffee Hage n shook his head. “I \\ncould have sworn it would have been Carlo or  maybe Clemenza. I never figured Tessio. \\nHe’s the best of the lot.” \\n“He’s the most intelligent,” Michael said. “A nd he did what seems to him to be the smart  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 351\\nthing. He sets me up for the hit by Barzin i and inherits the Corleone Family. He sticks \\nwith me and he gets wiped out; he’s figuring I can’t win.” \\nHagen paused before he asked reluctantly, “How right is he figuring?” \\nMichael shrugged. “It looks bad. But my fa ther was the only one  who understood that \\npolitical connections and power are worth ten regimes. I th ink I’ve got most of my \\nfather’s political power in my hands now, but I’m the only one  who really knows that.” He \\nsmiled at Hagen, a reassuring smile. “I’ll make them call me Don. But I feel lousy about \\nTessio.” \\nHagen said, “Have you agreed to the meeting with Barzini?” ’ \\n“Yeah,” Michael said. “A week from tonight. In  Brooklyn, on Tessio’s ground where I’ll be \\nsafe.” He laughed again. \\nHagen said, “Be careful before then.” \\nFor the first time Michael wa s cold with Hagen. “I  don’t need a Consig liere to give me \\nthat kind of advice,” he said. \\n* * *  \\nDuring the week preceding the peace m eeting between the Corleone and Barzini \\nFamilies, Michael showed Hagen just how care ful he could be. He never set foot outside \\nthe mall and never received an yone without Neri beside hi m. There was only one \\nannoying complication. Connie and Carlo’s oldest boy was to receive his Confirmation in \\nthe Catholic Church and Kay asked Michael  to be the Godfather . Michael refused. \\n“I don’t often beg you,” Kay said. “Please do this just for me. Connie wants it so much. \\nAnd so does Carlo. It’s very impor tant to them. Please, Michael.” \\nShe could see he was angry with  her for insisting and expec ted him to refuse. So she \\nwas surprised when he nodded and said, “OK. But I can’t leave the mall. Tell them to \\narrange for the priest to confirm the kid here. I ’ll pay whatever it cost s. If they run into \\ntrouble with the church people, Hagen will straighten it out.” \\nAnd so the day before the me eting with the Barzini Fam ily, Michael Corleone stood \\nGodfather to the son of Carl o and Connie Rizzi. He present ed the boy with an extremely \\nexpensive wristwatch and gold band. There was a small party in Carlo’s house, to which \\nwere invited the caporegimes, Hagen, Lampone and everyone who lived on the mall, \\nincluding, of course, the Don’s widow. Connie was so over come with emotion that she \\nhugged and kissed her brother and Kay all during the evening. And even Carlo Rizzi  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 352\\nbecame sentimental, wringing Michael’s hand and calling him Godfather at every \\nexcuse– old country style. Michael himself had never been so affable, so outgoing. \\nConnie whispered to Kay, “I think Carlo a nd Mike are going to be real friends now. \\nSomething like this always brings people together.” \\nKay squeezed her sister-in-law’s arm. “I’m so glad,” she said. \\nChapter 30 \\nAlbert Neri sat in his Bronx  apartment and carefully brushed the blue serge of his old \\npoliceman’s uniform. He unpinn ed the badge and set it on the ta ble to be polished. The \\nregulation holster and gun were  draped over a chair. This ol d routine of det ail made him \\nhappy in some strange way, one of the fe w times he had felt happy since his wife had \\nleft him, nearly two years ago. \\nHe had married Rita when she wa s a high school kid and he was a rookie policeman. \\nShe was shy, dark-haired, from a straitlac ed Italian family who never let her stay out \\nlater than ten o’clock at night. Neri was comple tely in love with her, her innocence, her \\nvirtue, as well as her dark prettiness. \\nAt first Rita Neri was fascinated by her husband. He was immensely strong and she \\ncould see people were afraid of him because  of that strength and his unbending attitude \\ntoward what was right and wron g. He was rarely tactful. If he disagreed with a group’s \\nattitude or an individual’s opinion, he kept his mouth shut or brutally spoke his \\ncontradiction. He never gave a polite agreement. He also had a true Sicilian temper and \\nhis rages could be awesome. But he was never angry with his wife. \\nNeri in the space of five years became one of the most fear ed policemen on the New \\nYork City force. Also one of the most honest. But he had his own ways of enforcing the law. He hated punks and when he saw a bunch of young rowdies making a disturbance \\non a street corner at night, disturbing passersby, he took quick and decisive action. He \\nemployed a physical strength that  was truly extraordinary, which he himself did not fully \\nappreciate. \\nOne night in Central Park West he jumped ou t of the patrol car and lined up six punks in \\nblack silk jackets. His partner remained in the driver’s seat, not wanting to get involved, \\nknowing Neri. The six boys, all in their late teens, had been stopping people and asking \\nthem for cigarettes in a yout hfully menacing way but not doing anyone any real physical \\nharm. They had also teased girls going by with a sexual gesture more French than \\nAmerican.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 353\\nNeri lined them up against the stone wall that closed off Central Park from Eighth \\nAvenue. It was twilight, but Neri  carried his favorite weapon, a huge flashlight. He never \\nbothered drawing his gun; it was never necessa ry. His face when he was angry was so \\nbrutally menacing, combined with his uniform, that the us ual punks were cowed. These \\nwere no exception. \\nNeri asked the first youth in the black silk  jacket, “What’s your name?” The kid answered \\nwith an Irish name. Neri told him, “Get off the street. I see you again tonight, I’ll crucify \\nyou.” He motioned with his flashlight and the youth walked quickly away. Neri followed \\nthe same procedure with the next  two boys. He let them wa lk off. But the fourth boy \\ngave an Italian name and smiled at Neri as if to  claim some sort of kinship. Neri was \\nunmistakably of Italian descent. Neri look ed at this youth for a moment and asked \\nsuperfluously, “You Italian?” The boy grinned confidently. \\nNeri hit him a stunning blow on the forehead with his flashlight. The boy dropped to his \\nknees. The skin and flesh of his forehead ha d cracked open and bl ood poured down his \\nface. But it was strictly a flesh wound. Neri said to him harshly, “You son of a bitch, \\nyou’re a disgrace to the Italians. You give us all a bad name. Get on your feet.” He gave \\nthe youth a kick in the side, not gentle, not too hard. “Get home and stay off the street. \\nDon’t ever let me catch you wearing that jacket again either. I’ll send you to the hospital. \\nNow get home. You’re lucky I’m not your father.” \\nNeri didn’t bother with the ot her two punks. He just booted their asses down the Avenue, \\ntelling them he didn’t want them on the street that night. \\nIn such encounters all was done so quickly t hat there was no time for a crowd to gather \\nor for someone to protest his actions. Neri wo uld get into the patro l car and his partner \\nwould zoom it away. Of course once in a while there would be a real hard case who \\nwanted to fight and might even pull a knife. These were truly unfortunate people. Neri \\nwould, with awesome, quick ferocity, beat t hem bloody and throw them into the patrol \\ncar. They would be put under arrest and char ged with assaulting an officer. But usually \\ntheir case would have to wait until they were discharged from the hospital. \\nEventually Neri was transferred to the beat t hat held the United Nations building area, \\nmainly because he had not show n his precinct sergeant the proper respect. The United \\nNations people with their diplom atic immunity parked their lim ousines all over  the streets \\nwithout regard to police regulations. Neri comp lained to the precinct and was told not to \\nmake waves, to just ignore it. But one night  there was a whole side street that was  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 354\\nimpassable because of the carelessly parked aut os. It was after midni ght, so Neri took \\nhis huge flashlight from the patrol car and went  down the street smashing windshields to \\nsmithereens. It was not easy, even for high-r anking diplomats, to get the windshields \\nrepaired in less than a few days. Protests poured into t he police precinct station house \\ndemanding protection against this vandalism. A fter a week of windshield smashing the \\ntruth gradually hit somebody about what wa s actually happening and Albert Neri was \\ntransferred to Harlem. \\nOne Sunday shortly afterward, Neri took his wife to visit his widowed sister in Brooklyn. \\nAlbert Neri had the fierce protective affecti on for his sister commo n to all Sicilians and \\nhe always visited her at least once every couple of months to make sure she was all \\nright. She was much older than he was and had a son who was twenty. This son, \\nThomas, without a father’s hand, was giving  trouble. He had gotten into a few minor \\nscrapes, was running a little wild. Neri had once  used his contacts on the police force to \\nkeep the youth from being charged with larc eny. On that occasion he had kept his anger \\nin check but had given his nephew a warning. “T ommy, you make my sister cry over you \\nand I’ll straighten you out myself.” It was intended as a fr iendly pally-uncle warning, not \\nreally as a threat. But even though Tommy was the toughest kid in that tough Brooklyn \\nneighborhood, he was afraid of his Uncle Al. \\nOn this particular visit Tommy had come in  very late Saturday night and was still \\nsleeping in his room. His mother  went to wake him, telling him to get dressed so that he \\ncould eat Sunday dinner with his uncle and aunt. The boy’s voice came harshly through \\nthe partly opened door, “I don’t give a shit, let me sleep,” and his mother came back out \\ninto the kitchen smiling apologetically. \\nSo they had to eat their dinn er without him. Neri asked his sister if Tommy was giving \\nher any real trouble and she shook her head. \\nNeri and his wife were about to leave when To mmy finally got up. He barely grumbled a \\nhello and went into the kitche n. Finally he yelled in to hi s mother, “Hey, Ma, how about \\ncooking me something to eat?” But it was not  a request. It was the spoiled complaint of \\nan indulged child. \\nHis mother said shrilly, “Get up when it’s dinnertime and then you can eat. I’m not going \\nto cook again for you.” \\nIt was the sort of little ugly scene that was fairly commonplace, but Tommy still a little \\nirritable from his slumber m ade a mistake. “Ah, fuck you and your nagging, I’ll go out  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 355\\nand eat.” As soon as he said it he regretted it. \\nHis Uncle Al was on him like a cat on a mouse. Not so much for the insult to his sister \\nthis particular day but because it was obvious that he often talked to his mother in such \\na fashion when they were alone. Tommy neve r dared say such a thing in from of her \\nbrother. This particular Sunday he had ju st been careless. To his misfortune. \\nBefore the frightened eyes of the two wo men, Al Neri gave his nephew a merciless, \\ncareful, physical beating. At first the youth made an attemp t at self-defense but soon \\ngave that up and begged for mer cy. Neri slapped his face until  the lips were swollen and \\nbloody. He rocked the kid’s head back and slammed him against the wall. He punched \\nhim in the stomach, then got him prone on the floor and slapped his face into the carpet. \\nHe told the two women to wait and made Tommy go down the street and get into his \\ncar. There he put the fear of God into him. “If my sister ever tells me you talk like that to \\nher again, this beating will seem like kisses fr om a broad,” he told Tommy. “I want to see \\nyou straighten out. Now go up the house an d tell my wife I’m waiting for her.” \\nIt was two months after this that Al Neri go t back from a late shift on the force and found \\nhis wife had left him. She had packed all he r clothes and gone back to her family. Her \\nfather told him that Rita was afraid of him, that  she was afraid to live with him because \\nof his temper. Al was stunned with disbe lief. He had never struck his wife, never \\nthreatened her in any way, had never felt anything but affection for her. But he was so \\nbewildered by her action that he decided to let a few days go by before he went over to \\nher family’s house to talk to her. \\nIt was unfortunate that the next  night he ran into trouble on hi s shift. His car answered a \\ncall in Harlem, a report of a deadly assault. As  usual Neri jumped out of the patrol car \\nwhile it was still rolling to a stop. It was after midnight and he was carrying his huge \\nflashlight. It was easy spotting the troubl e. There was a crowd gathered outside a \\ntenement doorway. One Negro woman said to Neri, “There’ s a man in there cutting a \\nlittle girl.” \\nNeri went into the hallway. There was an open door at the far end with light streaming \\nout and he could hear moaning. St ill handling the flashlight, he went down the hall and \\nthrough the open doorway. \\nHe almost fell over two bodies stretched out  on the floor. One was a Negro woman of \\nabout twenty-five. The other was a Negro girl of no more than twelve. Both were bloody \\nfrom razor cuts on their faces and bodies. In the living room Neri saw the man who was  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 356\\nresponsible. He knew him well. \\nThe man was Wax Baines, a notorious pimp, dope pusher an d strong-arm artist. His \\neyes were popping from drugs now, the bloody knife he held in his hand wavered. Neri \\nhad arrested him two weeks before for severe ly assaulting one of his whores in the \\nstreet. Baines had told him, “Hey, man, this  none of your business.” And Neri’s partner \\nhad also said something about letting the nigger s cut each other up if they wanted to, \\nbut Neri had hauled Baines into the station hous e. Baines was bailed out the very next \\nday. \\nNeri had never much liked Negroes, and working in Harlem had made him like them \\neven less. They all were on dr ugs or booze while they let their women work or peddle \\nass. He didn’t have any use for any of the bas tards. So Baines’ brazen breaking of the \\nlaw infuriated him. And the sight of the littl e girl all cut up with the razor sickened him. \\nQuite coolly, in his own mind, he decided not to bring Baines in. \\nBut witnesses were already crowding into  the apartment behind him, some people who \\nlived in the building and his par tner from the patrol car. \\nNeri ordered Baines, “Drop your knife, you’re under arrest.” \\nBaines laughed. “Man, you gotta  use your gun to arrest me.”  He held his knife up. “Or \\nmaybe you want this.” \\nNeri moved very quickly, so his partner woul d not have time to draw a gun. The Negro \\nstabbed with his knife, but Ner i’s extraordinary reflexes enabl ed him to catch the thrust \\nwith his left palm. With his right  hand he swung the flashlight in a short vicious arc. The \\nblow caught Baines on the side of the head and made his k nees buckle comically like a \\ndrunk’s. The knife dro pped from his hand. He was quite helpless. So  Neri’s second blow \\nwas inexcusable, as the police departmental hear ing and his criminal trial later proved \\nwith the help of the testimony  of witnesses and his fellow policeman. Neri brought the \\nflashlight down on the top of  Baines’ skull in an incredibly powerful blow which shattered \\nthe glass of the flashlight; the enamel shie ld and the bulb itself popping out and flying \\nacross the room. The heavy aluminum barrel of  the flashlight tube bent and only the \\nbatteries inside prevented it from doubling on itself. One awed onlooker, a Negro man who lived in the tenement and later testif ied against Neri, said, “Man that’s a \\nhard-headed nigger.” \\nBut Baines’ head was not quite hard enough. The blow caved in his skull. He died two hours later in the Harlem Hospital.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 357\\nAlbert Neri was the only one surprised when he was brought up on departmental \\ncharges for using excessive force. He was suspended and criminal charges were \\nbrought against him. He was indicted for manslaughter, convicted and sentenced to \\nfrom one to ten years in prison. By this time he was so filled with a baffled rage and \\nhatred of all society that he di dn’t give a damn. That they  dared to judge him a criminal! \\nThat they dared to send him to prison for k illing an animal like that pimp-nigger! That \\nthey didn’t give a damn for the woman and little girl who had  been carved up, disfigured \\nfor life, and still in the hospital. \\nHe did not fear prison. He  felt that because of his having been a policeman and \\nespecially because of the nature of the offense, he would be we ll taken care of. Several \\nof his buddy officers had already assured hi m they would speak to friends. Only his \\nwife’s father, a shrewd old-style Italian who owned a fish market in the Bronx, realized \\nthat a man like Albert Neri had little chance of  surviving a year in prison. One of his \\nfellow inmates might kill him; if not, he was almost  certain to kill one of them. Out of guilt \\nthat his daughter had deserted a fine husband for some womanly foolishness, Neri’s \\nfather-in-law used his contac ts with the Corleone Family ( he paid protection money to \\none of its representatives and su pplied the Corleone itself with the finest fish available, \\nas a gift), he petitioned for their intercession. \\nThe Corleone Family knew about Albert Neri. He was something of a legend as a \\nlegitimately tough cop; he had made a certain r eputation as a man not to be held lightly, \\nas a man who could inspire fear out of his own person regar dless of the uniform and the \\nsanctioned gun he wore. The Corleone Family was always interested in such man.. The \\nfact that he was a policem an did not mean too much. Many  young men started down a \\nfalse path to their true destiny. Time and fortune usually set them aright. \\nIt was Pete Clemenza, with his fine nose fo r good personnel, who brought the Neri affair \\nto Tom Hagen’s attention. Hage n studied the copy of the official police dossier and \\nlistened to Clemenza. He said, “May be we have another Luca Brasi here.” \\nClemenza nodded his head vigorous ly. Though he was very fat, his face had none of \\nthe usual stout man’s benignity. “My thinking exac tly. Mike should look into this himself.” \\nAnd so it was that before Albert Neri was transferred from the te mporary jail to what \\nwould have been his permanent residence upstate , he was informed that the judge had \\nreconsidered his case on the basis of new information and affidavits submitted by high police officials. His sentence was suspended and he was released.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 358\\nAlbert Neri was no fool and his father-in-law no shrinking violet. Neri learned what had \\nhappened and paid his debt to  his father-in-law by agreeing to get a divorce from Rita. \\nThen he made a trip out to Long Beach to thank  his benefactor. Arrangements had been \\nmade beforehand, of course. Michael received him in his library. \\nNeri stated his thanks in formal tones and was surprised and gratified by the warmth \\nwith which Michael received his thanks. \\n“Hell, I couldn’t let them do that to a fellow Sicilian,” Michael said. “They should have \\ngiven you a goddamn medal. But those damn polit icians don’t give a shit about anything \\nexcept pressure groups. List en, I would never have stepped into the picture if I hadn’t \\nchecked everything out and saw what a raw deal you got. One of my people talked to \\nyour sister and she told us how you were  always worried about her and her kid, how you \\nstraightened the kid out, kept him from going bad. Your father-in-law says you’re the \\nfinest fellow in the world. That’s rare.” Ta ctfully Michael did not mention anything about \\nNeri’s wife having left him. \\nThey chatted for a while. Neri had always been a taciturn man, but he found himself \\nopening up to Michael Corleone. Michael was only about five years his senior, but Neri \\nspoke to him as if he were much  older, older enough to be his father. \\nFinally Michael said, “There’s no sense getting you out of jail and t hen just leaving you \\nhigh and dry. I can arrange some work for y ou. I have interests out in Las Vegas, with \\nyour experience you could be a hotel security man. Or if there’s some little business \\nyou’d like to go into, I can put a word in with the banks to advance you a loan for capital.” \\nNeri was overcome with grateful embarra ssment. He proudly refused and then added, “I \\nhave to stay under the jurisdiction of the court anyway with the suspended sentence.” \\nMichael said briskly, “That’s all crap detail, I can fix that. Forget about that supervision \\nand just so the banks won’t get choosy I’ll have your yellow sheet pulled.” \\nThe yellow sheet was a police re cord of criminal offenses committed by any individual. It \\nwas usually submitted to a judge when he wa s considering what sentence to give a \\nconvicted criminal. Neri had been long enough on the police force to know that many \\nhoodlums going up for sentencing had been treat ed leniently by the judge because a \\nclean yellow sheet had been submitted by t he bribed Police Record s Department. So he \\nwas not too surprised that Michael Corleone could do such  a thing; he was, however, \\nsurprised that such trouble would be taken on his account.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 359\\n“If I need help, I’ll get in touch,” Neri said. \\n“Good, good,” Michael said. He looked at his wa tch and Neri took this for his dismissal. \\nHe rose to go. Again he was surprised. \\n“Lunchtime,” Michael said. “C ome on and eat with me and my family. My father said \\nhe’d like to meet you. We’ll walk over to his house. My mother should have some fried \\npeppers and eggs and sausages. Real Sicilian style.” \\nThat afternoon was the most agr eeable Albert Neri had spent since he was a small boy, \\nsince the days before his parents had died when he was only fifteen. Don Corleone was at his most amiable and was delighted when he discovered that Neri’s parents had \\noriginally come from a small village only a few minutes from his ow n. The talk was good, \\nthe food was delicious, the wine robustly red. Neri was struck by the thought that he was \\nfinally with his own true peopl e. He understood that he was only a casual guest but he \\nknew he could find a permanent place and be hazy in such a world. \\nMichael and the Don walked him out to his car. The Don shook his hand and said, \\n“You’re a fine fellow. My son Michael here, I’ve been teaching him the olive business, \\nI’m getting old, I want to retire. And he comes to me and he says he wants to interfere in \\nyour little affair. I tell him to just learn about  the olive oil. But he won’t leave me alone. \\nHe says, here is this fine fellow, a Sicilian a nd they are doing this dirty trick to him. He \\nkept on, he gave me no peace until I interested myse lf in it. I tell you this to tell that he \\nwas right. Now that I’ve met you, I’m glad we took the trouble. So if we can do anything \\nfurther for you, just ask the favor. Under stand? We’re at your se rvice.” (Remembering \\nthe Don’s kindness, Neri wished the great m an was still alive to see the service that \\nwould be done this day.) \\nIt took Neri less than three days to make up his mind. He understood he was being courted but understood more. That the Corleone Fa mily approved that act of his which \\nsociety condemned and had punished him for. T he Corleone Family valued him, society \\ndid not. He understood that he would be happier  in the world the Corleones had created \\nthan in the world outside. And he understood that the Corleone Fa mily was the more \\npowerful, within its narrower limits. \\nHe visited Michael again and put his cards on the table. He did not want to work in Vegas but he would take a job with the Family in New York . He made his loyalty clear. \\nMichael was touched, Neri could see that. It was arranged. But Michael insisted that \\nNeri take a vacation first, down in Miami at the Family hotel there,  all expenses paid and  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 360\\na month’s salary in advance so he could have the necessary cash to enjoy himself \\nproperly. \\nThat vacation was Neri’s first taste of luxury . People at the hotel took special care of \\nhim, saying, “Ah, you’re a friend of Michael Corleone.” The word had been passed \\nalong. He was given one of the plush suites, not the grudging small room a poor relation \\nmight be fobbed off with. The man running t he nightclub in the hotel fixed him up with \\nsome beautiful girls. When Neri  got back to New York he had a slightly different view on \\nlife in general. \\nHe was put in the Clemenza regime and tested carefully by that masterful personnel \\nman. Certain precautions had to be taken. He had, after all, once been a policeman. But \\nNeri’s natural ferocity overcame whatev er scruples he might have had at being on the \\nother side of the fence. In less than a year he had “made his bones.” He could never \\nturn back. \\nClemenza sang his praises. Neri was a won der, the new Luca Brasi. He would be better \\nthan Luca, Clemenza bragged. Afte r all, Neri was his discovery. Physically the man was \\na marvel. His reflexes and coordination such  that he could have been another Joe \\nDiMaggio. Clemenza also knew that Neri was not a man to be controlled by someone \\nlike himself. Neri was made directly respons ible to Michael Corleone, with Tom Hagen \\nas the necessary buffer. He was a “specia l” and as such commanded a high salary but \\ndid not have his own living, a bookmaking or strong-arm oper ation. It was obvious that \\nhis respect for Michael Corleone was eno rmous and one day Hagen said jokingly to \\nMichael, “Well now you’ve got your Luca.” \\nMichael nodded. He had brought it off. Albert Neri was his man to the death. And of \\ncourse it was a trick lear ned from the Don himself. While learning the business, \\nundergoing the long days of tu telage by his father, Michael  had one time asked, “How \\ncome you used a guy like Luca Brasi? An animal like that?” \\nThe Don had proceeded to instruct  him. “There are men in this world,” he said, “who go \\nabout demanding to be killed. You must have noticed them. They quarrel in gambling \\ngames, they jump out of their automobiles in  a rage if someone so much as scratches \\ntheir fender, they humiliate and bully people whose capabilities they do not know. I have \\nseen a man, a fool, deliber ately infuriate a group of dangerous men, and he himself \\nwithout any resources. These are people who wander through the world shouting, ‘Kill \\nme. Kill me.’ And there is always somebody ready to oblige them. We read about it in  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 361\\nthe newspapers every day. Such people of c ourse do a great deal of harm to others \\nalso. \\n“Luca Brasi was such a man. But he was such  an extraordinary man t hat for a long time \\nnobody could kill him. Most of these people are of no concern to ourselves but a Brasi is \\na powerful weapon to be used. T he trick is that since he does  not fear death and indeed \\nlooks for it, then the trick is to make yourse lf the only person in the world that he truly \\ndesires not to kill him. He has only that one fear, not of death, but  that you may be the \\none to kill him. He is yours then.” \\nIt was one of the most valuable lessons giv en by the Don before he died, and Michael \\nhad used it to make Neri his Luca Brasi. \\n* * *  \\nAnd now, finally, Albert Neri , alone in his Bronx apartment, was going to put on his \\npolice uniform again. He brushed it carefully . Polishing the holster would be next. And \\nhis policeman’s cap too, the vi sor had to be cleaned, the stout  black shoes shined. Neri \\nworked with a will. He had found his place in the world, Michael Corelone had placed his \\nabsolute trust in him, and today  he would not fail that trust. \\nChapter 31 \\nOn that same day two limousin es parked on the Long Beach mall. One of the big cars \\nwaited to take Connie Corleone, her mot her, her husband and her two children to the \\nairport. The Carlo Rizzi family was to take a vacation in Las Vegas in preparation for \\ntheir permanent move to that city. Michael  had given Carlo the or der, over Connie’s \\nprotests. Michael had not bother ed to explain that he wanted everyone out of the mall \\nbefore the Corleone-Barzini Fami lies’ meeting. Indeed the meet ing itself was top secret. \\nThe only ones who knew about it were the capos of the Family. \\nThe other limousine was for Kay and her child ren, who were being driven up to New \\nHampshire for a visit with her parents. Michael  would have to stay in the mall; he had \\naffairs too pressing to leave. \\nThe night before Michael had also sent word to Carlo Rizzi that he would require his \\npresence on the mall for a few days, that he c ould join his wife and children later that \\nweek. Connie had been furious. She had tri ed to get Michael on the phone, but he had \\ngone into the city. Now her eyes were searching the mall for him, but he was closeted \\nwith Tom Hagen and not to be disturbed. Connie kissed Carlo good-bye when he put  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 362\\nher in the limousine. “ If you don’t come out there in two days, I’ll come back to get you,” \\nshe threatened him. \\nHe gave her a polite husbandly smile of sexual complicity. “I’ll be there,” he said. \\nShe hung out the window. “What do you think Michael wants you for?” she asked. Her \\nworried frown made her look old and unattractive. \\nCarlo shrugged. “He’s been promis ing me a big deal. Maybe that ’s what he wants to talk \\nabout. That’s what he hinted anyway.” Carlo did not know of th e meeting scheduled with \\nthe Barzini Family for that night. \\nConnie said eagerly, “Really, Carlo?” \\nCarlo nodded at her reassuringly. The lim ousine moved off through the gates of the \\nmall. \\nIt was only after the first limousine had left t hat Michael appeared to say good-bye to \\nKay and his own two children. Carlo also ca me over and wished Kay a good trip and a \\ngood vacation. Finally the second limousi ne pulled away and went  through the gate. \\nMichael said, “I’m sorry I had to keep you here, Carlo. It won’t be more than a couple of \\ndays.” \\nCarlo said quickly, “I  don’t mind at all.” \\n“Good,” Michael said. “Just stay by your ph one and I’ll call you when I’m ready for you. I \\nhave to get some other dope before. OK?” \\n“Sure, Mike, sure,” Carlo said. He went into his own house, made a phone call to the \\nmistress he was discreetly keeping in Westbury, promising he would try to get to her late \\nthat night. Then he got set with a bottle of rye and waited. He waited a long time. Cars \\nstarted coming through the gate shortly afte r noontime. He saw Clemenza get out of \\none, and then a little later Tessio came out of  another. Both of th em were admitted to \\nMichael’s house by one of the bodyguards. Clemenza left after a few hours, but Tessio \\ndid not reappear. \\nCarlo took a breath of fres h air around the mall, not more than ten minutes. He was \\nfamiliar with all the guards who pulled duty on the mall, was even friendly with some of \\nthem. He thought he might gossip a bit to pass the time. But to his surprise none of the \\nguards today were men he knew. They were all strangers to him. Even more surprising, \\nthe man in charge at the gat e was Rocco Lampone, and Carlo knew that Rocco was of \\ntoo high a rank is the Family to be pu lling such menial duty unless something  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 363\\nextraordinary was afoot. \\nRocco gave him a friendly smile and hello. Ca rlo was wary. Rocco said, “Hey, I thought \\nyou were going an vacation with the Don?” \\nCarlo shrugged. “Mike wanted me to sti ck around for a couple of days. He has \\nsomething for me to do.” \\n“Yeah,” Rocco Lampone said. “Me too. Then he tells me to keep a check on the gate. \\nWell, what the hell, he’s t he boss.” His tones implied that Michael was not the man his \\nfather was; a bit derogatory. \\nCarlo ignored the tone. “Mike knows what he’s doing,” he said. Rocco accepted the \\nrebuke in silence. Carlo said so long and walked back to the house. Something was up, \\nbut Rocco didn’t know what it was. \\n* * *  \\nMichael stood in the window of his livi ng room and watched Carlo strolling around the \\nmall. Hagen brought him a drink, strong brandy. Michael sipped at it gratefully. Behind \\nhim, Hagen said, gently, “Mike, you have to start moving. It’s time.” \\nMichael sighed. “I wish it weren’t so soon. I wish the old man had lasted a little longer.” \\n“Nothing will go wrong,” Hagen said. “If I didn’t tumble, t hen nobody did. You set it up \\nreal good.” \\nMichael turned away from the window. “The ol d man planned a lot of it. I never realized \\nhow smart he was. But I guess you know.” \\n“Nobody like him,” Hagen said. “But this is beaut iful. This is the best. So you can’t be too \\nbad either.” \\n“Let’s see what happens,” Michael said . “Are Tessio and Clemenza on the mall?” \\nHagen nodded. Michael finished  the brandy in his glass. “Send Clemenza in to me. I’ll \\ninstruct him personally. I don’t want to see Tessio at all. Just tell him I’ll be ready to go to \\nthe Barzini meeting with him in about a half  hour. Clemenza’s people will take care of \\nhim after that.” \\nHagen said in a noncommittal voice, “Ther e’s no way to let Tessio off the hook?” \\n“No way,” Michael said. \\n* * *   “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 364\\nUpstate in the city of Buffalo , a small pizza parlor on a si de street was doing a rush \\ntrade. As the lunch hours passed, busines s finally slackened off and the counterman \\ntook his round tin tray with its few leftover slic es out of the window and put it on the shelf \\non the huge brick oven. He peeked into the ov en at a pie baking there. The cheese had \\nnot yet started to bubble. When he turned back to the counter that enabled him to serve \\npeople in the street, there was a young, t ough-looking man standing there. The man \\nsaid, “Gimme a slice.” \\nThe pizza counterman took hi s wooden shovel and scooped one of the cold slices into \\nthe oven to warm it up. The customer, instead of waiting outside, decided to come \\nthrough the door and be served. The store was empty now. The counterman opened the \\noven and took out the hot slice and served it on a paper plate. But the customer, instead \\nof giving the money for it, wa s staring at him intently. \\n“I hear you got a great tattoo on your chest,” t he customer said. “I can see the top of it \\nover your shirt, how about letting me see the rest of it?” \\nThe counterman froze. He seemed to be paralyzed. \\n“Open your shirt,” the customer said. \\nThe counterman shook his head. “I got no tatt oo,” he said in heavily accented English. \\n“That’s the man who works at night.” \\nThe customer laughed. It was an unpleasant laugh, harsh, strained. “Come on, unbutton \\nyour shirt, let me see.” \\nThe counterman started backing toward the r ear of the store, aiming to edge around the \\nhuge oven. But the customer ra ised his hand above the counter . There was a gun in it. \\nHe fired. The bullet caught the counterm an in the chest and hurled him against the \\noven. The customer fired into his body again and the counterman slumped to the floor. \\nThe customer came around the serving shel f, reached down and ripped the buttons off \\nthe shirt. The chest was covered with blood, but  the tattoo was visible, the intertwined \\nlovers and the knife transfixing them. The count erman raised one of his arms feebly as if \\nto protect himself. The gunman said, “Fabr izzio, Michael Corleone sends you his \\nregards.” He extended the gun so that it was only a few in ches from the counterman’s \\nskull and pulled the tri gger. Then he walked out of the st ore. At the curb a car was \\nwaiting for him with its door open. He jumped in and the car sped off. \\nRocco Lampone answered the phone installed on one of the iron pillars of the gate. He \\nheard someone saying, “Your package is ready ,” and the click as the caller hung up.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 365\\nRocco got into his car and drove out of the mall. He crossed the Jones Beach \\nCauseway, the same causeway on whic h Sonny Corleone had been killed, and drove \\nout to the railroad stat ion of Wantagh. He parked his car there. Another car was waiting \\nfor him with two men in it. They drove to a motel ten minutes fa rther out on Sunrise \\nHighway and turned into its c ourtyard. Rocco Lampone, leavin g his two men in the car, \\nwent to one of the little chal et-type bungalows. One kick sent its door flying off its hinges \\nand Rocco sprang into the room. \\nPhillip Tattaglia, seventy years old and nak ed as a baby, stood over a bed on which lay \\na young girl. Phillip Tattaglia’s  thick head of hair was jet bl ack, but the plumage of his \\ncrotch was steel gray. His body had the soft plumpness of a bird. Rocco pumped four \\nbullets into him, all in the belly. Then he turned and ran back to the car. The two men \\ndropped him off in the Wantagh station. He pi cked up his car and drove back to the mall. \\nHe went in to see Michael Corleone for a mo ment and then came out and took up his \\nposition at the gate. \\n* * *  \\nAlbert Neri, alone in his apartment, finished getting his uniform ready. Slowly he put it \\non, trousers, shirt, tie and jacket, holster an d gunbelt. He had turned in his gun when he \\nwas suspended from the force, but, through so me administrative oversight they had not \\nmade him give up his shield. Clemenza had supplied him with a new.38 Police Special \\nthat could not be traced. Neri broke it down, oiled it, checke d the hammer, put it together \\nagain, clicked the trigger. He l oaded the cylinders and was set to go. \\nHe put the policeman’s cap in a heavy paper bag and then put a civilian overcoat on to \\ncover his uniform. He checke d his watch. Fifteen minutes before the car would be \\nwaiting for him downstairs. He  spent the fifteen minutes checking himself in the mirror. \\nThere was no question. He looked like a real cop. \\nThe car was waiting with two of  Rocco Lampone’s men in fron t. Neri got into the back \\nseat. As the car started downtown, after they had left the neighborhood of his \\napartment, he shrugged off the civi lian overcoat and left it on the floor of the car. He \\nripped open the paper bag and put the police officer’s cap on his head. \\nAt 55th Street and Fifth Avenue the car pulled over to the curb and Neri got out. He \\nstarted walking down the aven ue. He had a queer feeling being back in uniform, \\npatrolling the streets as he had done so many times. There were crowds of people. He \\nwalked downtown until he was in front of Ro ckefeller Center, across the way from St.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 366\\nPatrick’s Cathedral. On his side of Fifth Avenue he spotted the limousine he was looking \\nfor. It was parked, nakedl y alone between a whole string of red NO PAR KING and No \\nSTANDING signs. Neri slowed his pace. He was too early. He stopped to write \\nsomething in his summons book and then kept walking. He was abreast of the \\nlimousine. He tapped its f ender with his nightstick. The driver  looked up in surprise. Neri \\npointed to the NO STANDING sign with his stick and motioned the driver to move his \\ncar. The driver turned his head away. \\nNeri walked out into the street so that he was standing by the driver’s open window. The \\ndriver was a tough-looking hood,  just the kind he loved to break up. Neri said with \\ndeliberate insultingness, “OK,  wise guy, you want me to st ick a summons up your ass or \\ndo you wanta get moving?” \\nThe driver said impassively, “You better check with your precinct. Just give me the ticket \\nif it’ll make you feel happy.” \\n“Get the hell out of here,” Neri  said, “or I’ll drag you out of that car and break your ass.” \\nThe driver made a ten-dollar b ill appear by some sort of magi c, folded it into a little \\nsquare using just one hand, attd tried to shove it inside Ne ri’s blouse. Neri moved back \\nonto the sidewalk and crooked his finger at the driver. The driv er came out of the car. \\n“Let me see your license and registration, ” Neri said. He had been hoping to get the \\ndriver to go around the block but there was no hope for that now. Out of the corner of his \\neye, Neri saw three short, heavyset men comi ng down the steps of the Plaza building, \\ncoming down toward the street. It was Barz ini himself and his two bodyguards, on their \\nway to meet Michael Corleone. Even as he saw this, one of the bodyguards peeled off \\nto come ahead and see what was wrong with Barzini’s car. \\nThis man asked the driver, “What’s up?” \\nThe driver said curtly, “I’m getting a ticket, no sweat. This guy must be new in the \\nprecinct.” \\nAt that moment Barzini came up with his other bodyguard. He growled, “What the hell is wrong now?” \\nNeri finished writing in his summons book and gave the driver back his registration and license. Then he put his summons book back in  his hip pocket and with the forward \\nmotion of his hand drew the.38 Special. \\nHe put three bullets in Barz ini’s barrel chest before the ot her three men unfroze enough  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 367\\nto dive for cover. By that time Neri had darted into the crow d and around the corner \\nwhere the car was waiting for him. The car sped up to Ninth Avenue and turned \\ndowntown. Near Chelsea Park, Neri, who had discarded the cap and put on the \\novercoat and changed clothing, transferred to another car that was waiting for him. He \\nhad left the gun and the police uniform in the other  car. It would be gotten rid of. An hour \\nlater he was safely in the mall on Long Beach and talking to Michael Corleone. \\n* * *  \\nTessio was waiting in the kitchen of the old Don’s hou se and was sipping at a cup of \\ncoffee when Tom Hagen came for him. “Mike is ready for you now,” Hagen said. “You \\nbetter make your call to Barzini and tell him to start on his way.” \\nTessio rose and went to the wa ll phone. He dialed Barzini’s o ffice in New York and said \\ncurtly, “We’re on our way to Brooklyn.” He hung up and smiled at  Hagen. “I hope Mike \\ncan get us a good deal tonight.” \\nHagen said gravely, “I’m su re he will.” He escorted Tessio out of the kitchen and onto \\nthe mall. They walked toward Michael’s house. At the door they were stopp ed by one of \\nthe bodyguards. “The boss says he’ll come in a separate car. He says for you two to go \\non ahead.” \\nTessio frowned and turned to Hagen. “Hell, he can’t do that; that screws up all my \\narrangements.” \\nAt that moment three more  bodyguards materialized around them. Hagen said gently, “I \\ncan’t go with you either, Tessio.” \\nThe ferret-faced caporegime understood ever ything in a flash of a second. And \\naccepted it. There was a moment of physica l weakness, and then he recovered. He said \\nto Hagen, “Tell Mike it was business, I always liked him.” \\nHagen nodded. “He understands that.” \\nTessio paused for a moment and then said so ftly, “Tom, can you get me off the hook? \\nFor old times’ sake?” \\nHagen shook his head. “I can’t,” he said. \\nHe watched Tessio being surrounded by bodyguards  and led into a waiting car. He felt a \\nlittle sick. Tessio had been the best soldier in the Corleone Family; the old Don had relied on him more than any other man with t he exception of Luca Brasi. It was too bad \\nthat so intelligent a man had made such a fa tal error in judgment so late in life.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 368\\n* * *  \\nCarlo Rizzi, still waiting for his interview with Michael, became jittery with all the arrivals \\nand departures. Obviously something big was goi ng on and it looked as  if he were going \\nto be left out. Impatiently he called Michae l on the phone. One of  the house bodyguards \\nanswered, went to get Michael, and came back with the message that Michael wanted \\nhim to sit tight, that he would get to him soon. \\nCarlo called up his mistress again and told her he was sure he would be able to take her \\nto a late supper and spend the night. Michael had said he would call him sin, whatever \\nhe had planned couldn’t take more than an hour, or two. Then it would take him about \\nforty minutes to drive to Westbury. It could be done. He promised he r he would do it and \\nsweet-talked her into not being sore. W hen he hung up he decided to get properly \\ndressed so as to save time afterward. He had just slipped into a fresh shirt when there was a knock on the door. He reasoned quickly that Mike had tried to get him on the \\nphone and had kept getting a busy signal so had si mply sent a messenger to call him. \\nCarlo went to the door and opened it. He felt  his whole body go weak with terrible \\nsickening fear. Standing in the d oorway was Michael Corleone, hi s face the face of that \\ndeath Carlo Rizzi saw often in his dreams. \\nBehind Michael Corleone were Hagen and Rocco Lampone. T hey looked grave, like \\npeople who had come with the utmo st reluctance to give a friend bad news. The three of \\nthem entered the house and Carlo Rizzi led t hem into the living r oom. Recovered from \\nhis first shock, he thought that he had suff ered an attack of nerves. Michael’s words \\nmade him really sick, physically nauseous. \\n“You have to answer for Santino,” Michael said. \\nCarlo didn’t answer, pretended not to underst and. Hagen and Lam pone had split away \\nto opposite walls of the room. He and Michael faced each other. \\n“You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people,” Mic hael said, his voice flat. “That little farce \\nyou played out with my sister, did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?” \\nCarlo Rizzi spoke out of his terrible fear, wit hout dignity, without an y kind of pride. “I \\nswear I’m innocent. I swear on the head of my  children I’m innocent. Mike, don’t do this \\nto me, please, Mike, don’t do this to me.” \\nMichael said quietly, “Barzini is dead. So is Phillip Tattag lia. I want to square all the \\nFamily accounts tonight. So don’t tell me you’ re innocent. It would be better for you to \\nadmit what you did.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 369\\nHagen and Lampone stared at Mi chael with astonishment. They were thinking that \\nMichael was not yet the man his father was. Why try to get th is traitor to admit guilt? \\nThat guilt was already proven as much as such a thing could be proven. The answer \\nwas obvious. Michael still was not that confi dent of his right, still feared being unjust, still \\nworried about that fraction of an uncertainty that only a conf ession by Carlo Rizzi could \\nerase. \\nThere was still no answer. Michael said almo st kindly, “Don’t be so frightened. Do you \\nthink I’d make my sister a widow? Do you think I’d make my nep hews fatherless? After \\nall I’m Godfather to one of your kids. No, your punishment will be that you won’t be \\nallowed any work with the Family. I’m putting you on a plane to Vegas to join your wife \\nand kids and then I want you to stay there. I’ll send Connie an  allowance. That’s all. But \\ndon’t keep saying you’re innocen t, don’t insult my intelligenc e and make me angry. Who \\napproached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?” \\nCarlo Rizzi in his anguished hope for life, in the sweet flooding relief that he was not \\ngoing to be killed, murmured, “Barzini.” \\n“Good, good,” Michael said softly. He beckoned wit h his right hand. “I want you to leave \\nnow. There’s a car waiting to take you to the airport.” \\nCarlo went out the door first, t he other three men very close to him. It was night now, but \\nthe mail as usual was bright with floodlights. A car pulled up.  Carlo saw it was his own \\ncar. He didn’t recognize the driver. There was someone sitting in the back but on the far \\nside. Lampone opened the front door and motioned to Carlo to  get in. Michael said, “I’ll \\ncall your wife and tell her you’re  on your way down.” Ca rlo got into the car. His silk shirt \\nwas soaked with sweat. \\nThe car pulled away, moving swi ftly toward the gate. Carlo st arted to turn his head to \\nsee if he knew the man sitting behind him. At that moment, Clemenza, as cunningly and \\ndaintily as a little girl slippi ng a ribbon over the head of a kitten, threw his garrot around \\nCarlo Rizzis neck. The smooth rope cut into the skin with Clemenza’s powerful yanking \\nthrottle, Carlo Rizzi’s body went  leaping into the air like a fish on a line, but Clemenza \\nheld him fast, tightening the gar rot until the body went slack.  Suddenly there was a foul \\nodor in the air of the car. Carlo’s body, sp hincter released by approaching death, had \\nvoided itself. Clemenza kept the garrot tight for another few minutes to make sure, then \\nreleased the rope and put it back in his po cket. He relaxed himself against the seat \\ncushions as Carlo’s body slumped agains t the door. After a few moments Clemenza  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 370\\nrolled the window down to  let out the stink. \\nThe victory of the Corleone Fa mily was complete. During that same twenty-four-hour \\nperiod Clemenza and Lam pone turned loose their regimes and punished the infiltrators \\nof the Corleone domains. Neri was sent to take command of the Tessio regime. Barzini \\nbookmakers were put out of business; two of the highest-ranking Barzini enforcers were \\nshot to death as they were peaceably pi cking their teeth over dinner in an Italian \\nrestaurant on Mulberry Street. A notorious fi xer of trotting races was also killed as he \\nreturned home from a winning ni ght at the track. Two of  the biggest shylocks on the \\nwaterfront disappeared, to  be found months later in the New Jersey swamps. \\nWith this one savage attack, Michael Co rleone made his reputation and restored the \\nCorleone Family to its primar y place in the New York Fam ilies. He was respected not \\nonly for his tactical brillance but because some of the most important caporegimes in \\nboth the Barzini and Tattaglia Families immediately went over to his side. \\nIt would have been a perfect triumph for Michael  Corleone except for an exhibition of \\nhysteria by his sister Connie. \\nConnie had flown home with her mother, t he children left in Vegas. She had restrained \\nher widow’s grief until the limousine pulled in to the mall. Then, before she could be \\nrestrained by her mother, she ran across the cobbled str eet to Michael Corleone’s \\nhouse. She burst through the door and found Michael and Ka y in the living room. Kay \\nstarted to go to her, to comfor t her and take her in her arms  in a sisterly embrace but \\nstopped short when Connie star ted screaming at her brot her, screaming curses and \\nreproaches. “You lousy bastard,” she shrieked.  “You killed my husband. You waited until \\nour father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him. You killed him. You \\nblamed him about Sonny, you alwa ys did, everybody did. But you never thought about \\nme. You never gave a damn about me. What am  I going to do now, what am I going to \\ndo?” She was wailing. Two of Michael’s bodyguards had come up behind her and were \\nwaiting for orders from him. Bu t he just stood there impassive ly and waited for his sister \\nto finish. \\nKay said in a shocked voice, “Connie, you’re upset, don’t say such things.” \\nConnie had recovered from her hysteria. Her voice held a deadly venom. “Why do you \\nthink he was always so cold to me? Why do you think he kept Carlo here on the mall? \\nAll the time he knew he was going to kill my  husband. But he didn’t dare while my father \\nwas alive. My father would have stopped him. He knew that. He was just waiting. And  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 371\\nthen he stood Godfather to our child just to throw us off the track. The coldhearted \\nbastard. You think you know your husband? Do you know how many men he had killed \\nwith my Carlo? Just read the papers. Barzini and Tattaglia and the others. My brother \\nhad them killed.” \\nShe had worked herself into hysteria again. S he tried to spit in Michael’s face but she \\nhad no saliva. \\n“Get her home and get her a doctor,” Mi chael said. The two guards immediately \\ngrabbed Connie’s arms and pull ed her out of the house. \\nKay was still shocked, still horrified. She sa id to her husband, “What made her say all \\nthose things, Michael, what makes her believe that?” \\nMichael shrugged. “She’s hysterical.” \\nKay looked into his eyes. “Michael, it’s  not true, please say it’s not true.” \\nMichael shook his head wearily. “Of course it ’s not. Just believe me, this one time I’m \\nletting you ask about my affairs, and I’m giving you an answer. It is not true.” He had \\nnever been more convincing. He looked dire ctly into her eyes. He was using all the \\nmutual trust they had built up in their marr ied life to make her believe him. And she \\ncould not doubt any longer. She smiled at him r uefully and came into his arms for a kiss. \\n“We both need a drink,” she said. She went into the kitchen for ice and while there heard \\nthe front door open. She went  out of the kitchen and sa w Clemenza, Neri and Rocco \\nLampone come in with the bodyguards. Michael had his back to her, but she moved so \\nthat she could see him in profile. At that moment Clemenza addressed her husband, \\ngreeting him formally. \\n“Don Michael,” Clemenza said. \\nKay could see how Michael stood to receiv e their homage. He reminded her of statues \\nin Rome, statues of those Roman emperors of antiquity, who, by divine right, held the \\npower of life and death over their fellow men. One hand was on his hip, the profile of his \\nface showed a cold proud power, his body was carelessly, arrogantly at ease, weight \\nresting on one foot slightly behind the other . The caporegimes stood before him. In that \\nmoment Kay knew that ever ything Connie had accused Michae l of was true. She went \\nback into the kitchen and wept. \\n  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 372\\nBook Nine  \\nChapter 32 \\nThe bloody victory of the Corleone Family was not complete until a year of delicate \\npolitical maneuvering established Michael Corl eone as the most powerfu l Family chief in \\nthe United States. For twelve months, Mi chael divided his time equally between his \\nheadquarters at the Long Beach mall and his new home in Las Vegas. But at the end of \\nthat year he decided to close out the Ne w York operation and sell the houses and the \\nmall property. For that purpos e he brought his whole family East on a last visit. They \\nwould stay a month, wind up business, Kay would do the per sonal family’s packing and \\nshipping of household goods. There were a million other minor details. \\nNow the Corleone Family was unchallenge able, and Clemenza had his own Family. \\nRocco Lampone was the Corleone caporegime. In Nevada, Albert Neri was head of all \\nsecurity for the Family-controlled hotels.  Hagen too was part of Michael’s Western \\nFamily. \\nTime helped heal the old wounds. Connie Corleone was reconciled to her brother \\nMichael. Indeed not more than a week after her  terrible accusations she apologized to \\nMichael for what she had said and assured Kay that there had been no truth in her \\nwords, that it had been only a young widow’s hysteria. \\nConnie Corleone easily found a new husband; in  fact, she did not wait the year of \\nrespect before filling her bed again with a fine young fellow who had come to work for \\nthe Corleone Family as a male secretary.  A boy from a reliable Italian family but \\ngraduated from the top business college in America. Naturally his marriage to the sister \\nof the Don made his future assured. \\nKay Adams Corleone had delighted her in-laws by taking instruction in the Catholic \\nreligion and joining that faith.  Her two boys were also, natura lly, being brought up in that \\nchurch, as was required. Michael himself ha d not been too pleased by this development. \\nHe would have preferred the children to be Protestant, it was more American. \\nTo her surprise, Kay came to love living in  Nevada. She loved the scenery, the hills and \\ncanyons of garishly red rock, the burni ng deserts, the unexpected and blessedly \\nrefreshing lakes, even the heat. Her tw o boys rode their own ponies. She had real \\nservants, not bodyguards. An d Michael lived a more normal life. He owned a \\nconstruction business; he joined the bus inessmen’s clubs and civic committees; he had  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 373\\na healthy interest in local po litic without interfer ing publicly. It was a good life. Kay was \\nhappy that they were closing down their New York house and that Las Vegas would be \\ntruly their permanent home. She hated coming back to New York. And so on this last trip \\nshe had arranged all the packing and shipping of  goods with the utmost efficiency and \\nspeed, and now on the final day she felt chat same urgen cy to leave that longtime \\npatients feel when it is time to  be discharged from  the hospital. \\nOn that final day, Kay Adams Cory woke at dawn. She could hear the roar of the truck \\nmotors outside on the mall. The trucks that w ould empty all the houses  of furniture. The \\nCorleone Family would be flying back to Las Vegas in the afternoon, including Mama \\nCorleone. \\nWhen Kay came out of the bathroom, Michael  was propped up on his pillow smoking a \\ncigarette. “Why the hell do you have to go to  church every morning?” he said. “I don’t \\nmind Sundays, but why the hell during the w eek? You’re as bad as my mother.” He \\nreached over in the darkness and switched on the tablelight. \\nKay sat at the edge of the bed to pull on her stockings. “You know how converted \\nCatholics are,” she said. “They take it more seriously.” \\nMichael reached over to touch her thigh, on  the warm skin where the top of her nylon \\nhose ended. “Don’t,” she said. “I’m  taking Communion this morning.” \\nHe didn’t try to hold her w hen she got up from the bed. He  said, smiling slightly, “If \\nyou’re such a strict Catholic, how come you let the kids du ck going to church so much?” \\nShe felt uncomfortable and sh e was wary. He was studying her with what sh e thought of \\nprivately as his “Don’s” eye. “They have plenty of time,” she sate. “When we get back \\nhome, I’ll make them attend more.” \\nShe kissed him good-bye before she left. Outside the house the air was already getting \\nwarm. The summer sun rising in the east wa s red. Kay walked to where her car was \\nparked near the gates of the mall. Mama Corleone, dress ed in her widow black, was \\nalready sitting in it, waiting for her. It had become a set routine, early Mass, every \\nmorning, together. \\nKay kissed the old woman’s wrinkled cheek, then got behind the w heel. Mama Corleone \\nasked suspiciously, “You eata breakfast?” \\n“No,” Kay said. \\nThe old woman nodded her head approvingly. Kay had once forgotten that it was  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 374\\nforbidden to take food from midnight on be fore receiving Holy Communion. That had \\nbeen a long time ago, but Mama Corleone nev er trusted her afte r that and always \\nchecked. “You feel all right ?” the old woman asked. \\n“Yes,” Kay said. \\nThe church was small and desolate in the early morning sunlight. Its stained-glass \\nwindows shielded the interior from heat, it w ould be cool there, a place to rest. Kay \\nhelped her mother-in-law up t he white stone steps  and then let her go before her. The \\nold woman preferred a pew up front, close to the altar. Kay waited on the steps for an \\nextra minute. She was always reluctant at th is last moment, always a little fearful. \\nFinally she entered the cool darkness. She took the holy water on her fingertips and \\nmade the sign of the cross, fleetingly touc hed her wet fingertips to her parched lips. \\nCandles flickered redly before the saints, the Christ on his cross. Kay genuflected before \\nentering her row and then knelt on the hard wooden rail of the pe w to wait for her call to \\nCommunion. She bowed her head as if she were praying, but she was not quite ready \\nfor that. \\n* * *  \\nIt was only here in these dim, vaulted churches that she al lowed herself to think about \\nher husband’s other life. About that terrible night a year ago when he had deliberately \\nused all their trust and love in  each other to make her believe his lie that he had not \\nkilled his sister’s husband. \\nShe had left him because of that lie, not bec ause of the deed. The next morning she had \\ntaken the children away with her to her par ents’ house in New Hampshire. Without a \\nword to anyone, without rea lly knowing what action she meant to take. Michael had \\nimmediately understood. He had called her the first day and then left her alone. It was a \\nweek before the limousine from New York  pulled up in front of her house with Tom \\nHagen. \\nShe had spent a long terrible afternoon with To m Hagen, the most terrible afternoon of \\nher life. They had gone for a walk in the woods outside her little town and Hagen had \\nnot been gentle. \\nKay had made the mistake of trying to be cruelly  flippant, a role to which she was not \\nsuited. “Did Mike send you up here to thr eaten me?” she asked. “I expected to see \\nsome of the ‘boys’ get out of the car with their machi ne guns to make me go back.”  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 375\\nFor the first time since she had known him, she saw Hagen angry. He said harshly, \\n“That’s the worst kind of juvenile crap I’ve  ever heard. I never expected that from a \\nwoman like you. Come on, Kay.” \\n“All right,” she said. \\nThey walked along the green c ountry road. Hagen asked quietly, “Why did you run \\naway?” \\nKay said, “Because Michael lied to me. Bec ause he made a fool of me when he stood \\nGodfather to Connie’s boy. He betrayed me. I can’t love a man like that. I can’t live with \\nit. I can’t let him be father to my children.” \\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Hagen said. \\nShe turned on him with now-justified rage. “I mean that he killed his sister’s husband. Do \\nyou understand that?” She paused for a moment. “And he lied to me.” \\nThey walked on for a long time in silence.  Finally Hagen said, “You have no way of \\nreally knowing that’s all true. But just for the sake of argument let’s assume that it’s true. \\nI’m not saying it is, remember. But what if I gave you what might be so me justification for \\nwhat he did. Or rather some possible justifications?” \\nKay looked at him scornfully. “That ’s the first time I’ve sees the lawyer side of you, Tom. \\nIt’s not your best side.” \\nHagen grinned. “OK. Just hear me out. W hat if Carlo had put Sonny on the spot, \\nfingered him. What if Carlo bea ting up Connie that time wa s a deliberate plot to get \\nSonny out in the open, that they knew he would take t he route over the Jones Beach \\nCauseway? What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed? Then what?” \\nKay didn’t answer. Hagen went on.  “And what if the Don, a great man, couldn’t bring \\nhimself to do what he had to do, avenge his son’s death by killing his daughter’s \\nhusband? What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his \\nsuccessor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that \\nguilt?” \\n“It was all over with,” Kay said, tears spri nging into her eyes. “Everybody was happy. \\nWhy couldn’t Carlo be forgiven? Why couldn ’t everything go on and everybody forget?” \\nShe had led across a meadow to a tree-s haded brook. Hagen sank down on the grass \\nand sighed. He looked around, sighed again and said, “In this world you could do it.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 376\\nKay said, “He’s not the man I married.” \\nHagen laughed shortly. “If he were, he’d be  dead now. You’d be a widow now. You’d \\nhave no problem.” \\nKay blazed out at him. “What the hell do es that mean? Come on, Tom, speak out \\nstraight once in your life. I know Michael can’t, but you’re not Sicilian, you can tell a \\nwoman the truth, you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.” \\nThere was another long silence.  Hagen shook his head. “You’ve got Mike wrong. You’re \\nmad because he lied to you. Well, he warned you never to ask him about business. \\nYou’re mad because he was G odfather to Carlo’s boy. But you made him do that. \\nActually it was the right move for him to make if he was going to take action against \\nCarlo. The classical tactical move to win the victim’s trust.” Hagen gave her a grim \\nsmile. “Is that straight enough talk for you?” But Kay bowed her head. \\nHagen went on. “I’ll give you some more strai ght talk. After the Don died, Mike was set \\nup to be killed. Do you know who set him u p? Tessio. So Tessio had to be killed. Carlo \\nhad to be killed. Because treachery can’t be forgiven. Michael could have forgiven it, but \\npeople never forgive themselves and so they  would always be dangerous. Michael \\nreally liked Tessio. He loves his sister. But he would be shirking his duty to you and his \\nchildren, to his whole family, to me and my family, if he let Tessio and Carlo go free. \\nThey would have been a danger to us all, all our lives.” \\nKay had been listening to this with tears running  down her face. “Is that what Michael \\nsent you up here to tell me?” \\nHagen looked at her in genuine surprise. “No,” he said. “He told me to tell you you could \\nhave everything you want and do everything you want as long as you take good care of \\nthe kids.” Hagen smiled. “He said to tell you t hat you’re his Don. That’s just a joke.” \\nKay put her hand on Hagen’s arm. “He didn’t order  you to tell me all the other things?” \\nHagen hesitated a moment as if  debating whether to tell her a final truth. “You still don’t \\nunderstand,” he said. “If you told Michael what I’ve told y ou today, I’m a dead man.” He \\npaused again. “You and the childr en are the only people on this earth he couldn’t harm.” \\nIt was a long five minutes afte r that Kay rose from the gr ass and they started walking \\nback to the house. When they were almost there, Kay said to Hagen, “After supper, can \\nyou drive me and the kids to New York in your car?” \\n“That’s what I came for,” Hagen said.  “The Godfather” By Mario Puzo  \\n \\n \\n 377\\nA week after she returned to Michael she went  to a priest for instruction to become a \\nCatholic. \\n* * *  \\nFrom the innermost recess of the church th e bell tolled for repentance. As she had been \\ntaught to do, Kay struck her breast lightly  with her clenched hand, the stroke of \\nrepentance. The bell tolled again and there was the shuffling of feet as the \\ncommunicants left their seats to go to the altar rail. Kay rose to join them. She knelt at \\nthe altar and from the depths of the church the bell tolled again. With her closed hand \\nshe struck her heart once more. The priest was before her. She tilted back her head and \\nopened her mouth to receive the papery thin wafe r. This was the most terrible moment \\nof all. Until it melted away and she could swallow and she could do what she came to \\ndo. \\nWashed clean of sin, a favored supplicant, she bowed her head and folded her hands \\nover the altar rail. She shifted her body to make her weight less punishing to her knees. \\nShe emptied her mind of all thought of herself, of her ch ildren, of all anger, of all \\nrebellion, of all questions. Then with a profound and deeply willed desir e to believe, to \\nbe heard, as she had done  every day since the murder of Carlo Rizzi, she said the \\nnecessary prayers for the soul of Michael Corleone. \\n '"
